These painters were largely responsible for fuelling the 18th-century vogue for nocturnal subjects. The sense of the overwhelming power of nature is a key theme of the Sublime. The potency of the moonlight contrasts with the delicate vulnerability of the flickering lantern, emphasising natures power over mankind and the fishermens fate in particular.

They demonstrated the primal force of the elements, a nightmare for all who travelled far from home. Turner retained a lifelong passion for the sea. We dont know whether this painting was inspired by an actual shipwreck, or the reissue in 1804 of a famous poem on the theme by William Falconer. Turner defines the essence of such an experience through overwhelming impressions of realism and horror.

Death appears, not as a triumphant, upright figure astride his horse, but as a phantom emerging from a turbulent mist: his skeletal form, arms outstretched, and draped submissively over the horses pale back.

Landseer writes as follows:We had not imagined that any VIEW of MARGATE, under any circumstances, would have made a picture of so much importance as that which Mr. Turner has painted of this subject: but, by introducing a rising sun and a rough sea; by keeping the town of Margate itself in a morning mist from which the pier is emerging; and by treating the cliffs as a bold promontory in shade, he has produced a grand picture; and (while he contrasts the prevailing horizontal forms of thecompositionby the lines of upright masts and rigging) has given a special interest to his fore-ground by introducing the local incident of Margate wherries hailing and stopping a Hastings boat on her way to the London market, to purchase fish... The detail of the town and cliffs, being lost at the early hour which is represented, in the mistiness of the morning, and only the bolder forms being discernible, Margate acquires a grandeur we should in vain look for at any other time and under any other circumstances. The mill and brewery on the summit of the cliff behind which the sun is rising, from their general forms alone being visible become objects of great interest in thelandscape\u2014 appearing like magnificent temples.The main discrepancy between this description and the picture itself is that in the latter no pier is discernible emerging from the morning mist but there is perhaps the suspicion of a projecting quay which may have misled Landseer. Nor could the sea be fairly described as rough; Armstrong calls it fresh which seems more accurate. Against this, the incident in the foreground of the Hastings fishing smack and the Margate wherries surely provides the crucial evidence which must override all reasonable doubts about identifying this picture with the Margate exhibited in 1808. The picture must have darkened a good deal, especially in the water, since it was painted, and this may account for certain features mentioned by Landseer being less easily discernible today.Further confirmation of this identification is given, as Eric Shanes points out, by thewatercolourofc.1822 done forPicturesqueViews on the Southern Coast of England(Yale Center; Wilton 1969, p. 353 no. 470, repr., and Shanesloc. cit., colour pl. 36). This, though considerably later, shows much the same view.

However, in fact the letter in question does not mention the subject of any of the pictures that Turner was engaged inpaintingat that time (November) and the reference that he was getting on with Lord E's almost certainly alludes toPalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]) while the smaller 3 ft by 4 ftcanvasthat Turner finished to stop the visitors to his studio gabbling was probablyOrvieto(No. 292 [N00511]). Although, therefore, it remains possible thatJessicawas painted in Rome, there is no firm evidence to support this and it seems more likely that Turner painted it in the normal way immediately before its exhibition in 1830.An entirely different account of the origin ofJessicawas printed inThe Timesfor 9 December 1959 in an article by an anonymous writer whose mother was Lord Egremont's grand-daughter. The latter who, as a small child, remembered Turner well, in old age dictated some reminiscences of the artist's visits to Petworth. According to her, during a discussion among several celebrated painters who were then staying at Petworth, one of them, after chaffing Turner on his predilection for yellow, said A yellow background is all very well inlandscapes, but would not be possible in our kind of pictures. Turner replied, addressing his patron, subject pictures are not my style but I will undertake to paint a picture of a woman's head with a yellow background if Lord Egremont will give it a place in his gallery. Although the interval which elapsed between the exhibition ofJessicaand its reported purchase by Lord Egremont would seem to throw serious doubts on the authenticity of this story, it may yet contain a grain of truth concerning the genesis of the picture.Exhibited with the following quotation:Shylock\u2014\u201cJessica, shut the window, I say\u201d\u2014The Merchant of Venice.This quotation does not in fact occur inThe Merchant of Venicebut Turner must have had in mind the scene outside Shylock's house (Act II, scene v) when Shylock counsels Jessica:Lock up my doors ...But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements.However, Launcelot gives her different advice:Mistress, look out at window, for all this;There will come a Christian by,Will be worth a Jewess' eye.Ziff suggests, in his 1980 review of the first edition of this catalogue, that although Turner intended his Jessica to be Shakespeare's, he may also have had these lines from Rogers'sItalyin his mind:... Now a JessicaSung to her lute, her signal as she sateAt her half-open window ...This was perhaps the most violently abused of Turner's exhibited works to date. Wordsworth, who saw the picture at the R.A. in 1830 said It looks to me as if the painter had indulged in raw liver until he was very unwell. TheSunfor 3 May asked how an artist who could paintPalestrinacould deface the canvas by such a picture while theMorning Heraldof 18 May urged that in future theAcademicCouncil should have the veto, in which case they doubtless would have rejectedPilate washing his Handsand that thing calledJessica. TheMorning Chronicle, 3 May, wrote It looks like a lady getting out of a large mustard-pot, a description which theLiterary Gazette, 29 May, thought so apt that we feel the temptation to piracy to be irresistable. This sobriquet seems to have become attached to the picture, for G. Storey, whose notes on the Petworth pictures are given by Thornbury, refers to it thus: The picture called the \u201cMustard Pot\u201d, Turner's \u201cJessica\u201d, is a roundabout proof that Turner was a great man; for it seems to me that none but a great man dare have painted anything so bad. This view was echoed by Waagen who considered thatJessicashows that limits are assigned even to the most gifted. It is a truly frightful piece of scene painting.TheAthenaeumfor 5 June calledJessicathis daub of a drab, libelling Shakespeare out of a foggy window of King's yellow whileFraser's Magazine(2, 183031 p. 97) also referred to Turner's obsession with yellow, concluding that he must be incurably afflicted with jaundice on the retina.In fact, as Gage (1972) has pointed out, this is one of Turner's attempts to reinterpret the work of Rembrandt, not in terms ofchiaroscuro, but rather by a blaze of jewel-like colours, and it is certainly more successful thanRembrandt's Daughter(No. 238). Indeed, it is perhaps Turner's most appealing figure picture, containing as it does a hint of Watteauesque pathos.Gage also suggests that an immediate source forJessicamay have been Rembrandt'sYoung Woman at a Door(Gerson,Rembrandt. The Complete Edition of the Paintings1969, pl. 288, Art Institute of Chicago) which was exhibited in London at the British Institution in 1818 (100) and appeared at Christie's on 13 June 1829 (68). The catalogue of the Turner Bicentenary exhibition suggests rather that thecompositionrecalls that of Rembrandt'sLady with a Fanin the Royal Collection (Gerson, pl. 281), which was brought to England in 1814 by Niewenhuys and exhibited at the British Institution three times in the 1820s. Yet a third Rembrandt has been proposed as a source forJessicaby Mr Evan Maurer: theLucretiain Minneapolis (Gerson, pl. 395), who also holds a tassel in her left hand, wears her hair in the same style and with a pearl similarly placed in her hair. TheLucretiawas in the Wombwell collection in England by 1854 when seen by Waagen but it may well have come to England considerably earlier.Jessicacertainly has points in common with all three Rembrandts and, as none is really close enough to be considered the definitive model, perhaps Turner had them all at the back rather than in the front of his mind when he paintedJessica.In the 19834 Paris exhibition catalogue Gage suggests that Turner may have been influenced, especially in the palette ofJessica, by yet another Rembrandt, the celebratedJewish Bride(Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) which was in London in the hands of the dealer John Smith from 182536.Constable refers to the picture in a letter to C. R. Leslie written on 27 April 1832, in which he expresses alarm at the proposed reduction in the number of Varnishing Days allowed to R.A.s: As to Turner (to whom no doubt the blow was levelled) [see the entry for No. 238] nothing can reach him, he is in the cloudsThe lovely Jessica by his sideSat like a blooming Eastern bride.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

He kept a boat, and often stopped overnight at various landing-places.  He also painted on board, as here on small wood panels and sometimes, more ambitiously, on canvas.Painting in oils in the open air, direct from the subject, was becoming popular in the early nineteenth century, in response to a growing feeling for naturalism.  Turners oil sketches of the Thames painted around 1805 show him at the forefront of the trend.Gallery label, February 2010Does this text contain inaccurate information or language that you feel we should improve or change?We would like to hear from you.Read more",

    "description": "Technique and conditionThe linen canvas is generally in good condition although its turn-over edges are no longer extant. The oil paint is generally thinly painted onto a creamy white, oil based ground which is also thinly applied, thereby allowing the canvas weave texture to show. There are, however, localised areas of impasted paint in which the brushmarks are clearly visible. Turner has also scratched vigorously into the paint possibly with the end of his brush or a palette knife. There is a small patch of paint in the bottom with a canvas imprint. It is likely that this occurred in Turner's studio as he stacked wet paintings against one another.The craquelure pattern in the paint and ground is not general but rather seems to have occurred as a result of mechanical impact from the reverse and the canvas moving against the cross member.This painting may have lost glazes as a result of over cleaning in the past. Some of the impasto has also been flattened in the lining process. Otherwise losses to the paint and ground are very small and few and its condition is good. The painting does, however, have a somewhat dull appearance. This can be attributed in part to a dulling and darkening of the varnish. Fairly extensive mould staining as well as ingrained varnish/dirt residues in the interstices of the impasted paint certainly contributes to this effect.Elisabeth ReissnerApril 2000Read more",

Emerald green was the first intensely green pigment Turner could obtain, and had not long been available. Previous generations and many of his own circle mixed greens from blue and yellow, to give less intense and more harmonious shades.The dazzling light was created by using a palette knife, a brush, the brush-end, scratches from Turners thumb-nail (kept long for this purpose), and light blue paint to contrast with the yellow.

    "description": "Technique and conditionJ.M.W. Turner painted Chichester Canal sometime between 1827 and 1831.  It was executed on a single piece of linen canvas with a plain 1x1 weave.  The canvas was prepared with a single, smooth application of a white coloured, oil based primer.  During a previous restoration, the original tacking margins were removed and the canvas glue-paste lined onto another linen fabric.  Presumably the dimensions of the painting were not altered.  The lined painting was stretched over the present six member wooden stretcher and secured with iron tacks through the lining fabric on the outside edge.  The stretcher is expandable with non-mitred, double keyed, mortise and tenon joints and the front face of the stretcher bars are slightly bevelled.Examination does not yield evidence of initial preparation or underdrawing.  The artist applied oil paint to the front face only.  Paint application ranges from broad areas of colour to delicate, sketchy brushstrokes.  The painting is built up in many layers of varying thickness and opacity to create an atmospheric effect.  Thickness varies from thin with no brushstrokes or texture to thick paint with heavy impasto.  Areas of impasto are concentrated towards the centre of the composition where the sun is striking the clouds.  The painting is varnished with a natural resin varnish applied evenly and covering the entire painting.  Over the varnish short, quick brushstrokes of yellow glaze were applied to all areas of the painting.  It is undetermined if the glaze was applied by the artist after varnishing the painting as an intermediary step or applied by a restorer.The support, ground, and paint are stable overall with the exception of the uppermost paint layers.  These layers exhibit an extensive, fine network of cracking with some lifting edges resulting in numerous losses.  The inherently fragile surface is vulnerable to future loss and will continue to lift and flake despite treatment. Contraction cracking and general age cracking are visible, although the most disturbing of the contraction cracks has been retouched to minimise its appearance.  The paint surface displays a minor amount of abrasion and the impasto has been flattened slightly probably due to previous lining treatment.  The front and reverse are covered in a moderate layer of surface dirt and dust.  The varnish has yellowed and has decreased in gloss and transparency.  The painting was treated in the Tate Conservation Studio in February 2002.Julie SimekJanuary 2002Read more",

In theAcademycatalogue Turner added a curious note about the Prince having sailed his yacht, not a frigate - a confusion with his arrival in a yacht for his wedding to Princess Mary on 4th (!) November 1677.Gallery label, August 2004Does this text contain inaccurate information or language that you feel we should improve or change?We would like to hear from you.Read more",

He chose lines from Milton's Paradise Lost, describing the 'mists and exhalations' of the atmosphere at sunrise. These shifting airs and lights, and flock of sheep running before them, give the landscape a natural drama and intensity.

    "description": "Technique and conditionJ.M.W. Turner painted The Lake, Petworth: Sunset, Fighting Bucks between 1827 and 1831, on one of his frequent visits to Petworth.  It was executed on a single piece of linen canvas with a plain 1x1 weave.  The canvas was prepared with a single, smooth application of a white coloured, oil based primer.  During a previous restoration, the original tacking margins were removed and the canvas glue-paste lined onto another linen fabric.  Presumably the dimensions of the painting were not altered.  The lined painting was stretched over the present six member wooden stretcher and secured with iron tacks through the lining fabric on the outside edge.  The stretcher is expandable with non-mitred, double keyed, mortise and tenon joints and the front face of the stretcher bars are slightly bevelled.Examination does not yield evidence of initial preparation or underdrawing.  The artist applied oil paint to the front face only.  Paint application ranges from broad areas of colour to delicate, sketchy brushstrokes.  The painting is built up in many layers of varying thickness and opacity to create an atmospheric effect.  Thickness varies from thin with no brushstrokes or texture to thick paint with heavy impasto.  Areas of impasto are concentrated towards the centre of the composition where the sun is striking the clouds.  The painting is varnished with a natural resin varnish applied evenly and covering the entire painting.  Over the varnish short, quick brushstrokes of yellow glaze were applied to all areas of the painting.  It is undetermined if the glaze was applied by the artist after varnishing the painting as an intermediary step or applied by a restorer.Since its creation, the painting has been displayed at Petworth House.  The support, ground, and paint are stable overall with the exception of the uppermost paint layers.  These layers exhibit an extensive, fine network of cracking with some lifting edges resulting in minor loss.  The fragile surface is vulnerable to future loss.  Contraction crackle from the artists technique and choice of materials and general age cracking are visible although not visually disturbing.  The front and reverse are covered in a moderate layer of surface dirt and dust.  The varnish has yellowed and has decreased in gloss and transparency.  The painting was treated in the Tate Conservation Studio in February 2002.Julie SimekJanuary 2002Read more",

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.Nos. 31827 Small Italian Sketches, 1828?THESE small sketches on millboard are distinct in style from those, also from the Turner Bequest, found at the British Museum (Nos. 485500). Several are painted on muslin stretched over the millboard, but there is evidence that one of the sketches on muslin was originally on the same piece of millboard as one of those painted directly onto the board (see Nos. 324 [N05545] and 325 [N05535]). A number of these sketches seem to show landscapes in the vicinity of Rome and Naples. Though very different from earlier sketches from nature like those done of the Thamesc.1807 (Nos. 16094) they have a directness and freshness which suggests that they may also have been done out-of-doors, though with formal compositions in mind from the outset. There is no secure evidence that Turner went to Naples on his second visit to Rome but it would have been easy for him to do so, and this group of sketches has usually been dated to this visit. Nevertheless, they could have been done on the 1819 visit, when, however, Turner did a far greater amount of work onpaper. Evelyn Joll, in the 19834 Paris exhibition catalogue (p. 111), stresses the factors in favour of an 1819 dating though he does not commit himself to this; see also under Nos. 318 [N05526] and 319 [N05530].327.[N05481]Seascape1828?THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5481)Millboard, 16 1/2 \u00d7 20 1/2 (42 \u00d7 52)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (? one of 178 to 182, 5 each 1'8 1/2\" \u00d7 1'4 5/8\", see No. 323 [N05532]); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Lit.Davies 1946, p. 158.Fairly close in style to theStudy of Sea and Skypainted at Cowes in 1827 (No. 268 [N02001]) and therefore probably to be dated in the later 1820s;c.f.also No. 271 [N05491].

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 45386: Late Unfinished Sea Pieces,c. 183045THERE are two main problems about this group of works. The first is the question of dating: the dates adopted here are highly tentative and are based on the supposition that there is a logical progression from a more substantial, three-dimensional style to one that is more impressionistic and less solid, together with a feeling that Turner's colouring was perhaps at its strongest from the early to the mid 1830s. However, as will be noted, the compilers do not always agree on even the tentative datings given here. In any case, what may look like a less three-dimensional picture may in fact be merely a less finished picture.The second problem is that ofprovenanceand authenticity, in particular as it concerns smaller pictures outside the Turner Bequest, Nos. 47484, together with the somewhat similar works no longer accepted as genuine, Nos. 5558. That some such unfinished works escaped the Turner Bequest is certain, and a foundation is provided by those works that can be definitely or tentatively traced to John Pound, the son by her first marriage of Mrs Booth, Turner's mistress and housekeeper. In reviews of our first edition, exception was taken to some of our attributions by Luke Herrmann (Nos. 475, 478 and 484) and Jerrold Ziff (Nos. 480 and 481); interestingly, they do not agree. Of the works they doubt, No. 478 seems definitely to have been in the Pound sale at Christie's in 1865, while Nos. 480, 481 and 484 bear labels or are said to come from the Pound family.However, one should never let an apparently sound provenance stand in the way of one's judgment based on the visual evidence, and in this case there is one further element, the fact that, from 1848, for apparently the only time in his life, Turner employed an assistant, Francis Sherrell. According to Bernard Falk (1938, p. 213), whose reference is based on an obituary in theIsle of Thanet Gazettefor 23 September 1916, Turner gave Sherrell lessons in return for various services such as stretching hiscanvasesand running errands; John Gage (1969, p. 171) suggests that Sherrell may also have cleaned some of the pictures in Turner's studio at the instigation of the dealer Thomas Griffith, who was active in trying to obtain sales for Turner at this time. Nothing further seems to be known about Sherrell save that he died at Thanet in 1916. It is perhaps an unworthy suspicion to suggest that he, more than anybody else, would have been in a position to imitate Turner's late style and that such imitations could have been left in Turner's studio and acquired by the Pound family.Another suspicious circumstance is that, although Turner tended to work on standard sizes of canvas, only a few of those of this group of pictures that are outside the Turner Bequest can be matched with works in the Bequest: No. 472, near enough Turner's standard three feet by four feet; No. 474, much the same size as Nos. 457 [N02881] and 458 [N02882]; Nos. 475, 482, and 556a, close to No. 459 [N05495]; and Nos. 483 and 484, the same size as Nos. 485 [D36675] and 486.Lit.Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, p. 62; Herrmann 1978, p. 773; Wilton 1979, p. 224; Ziff 1980, p. 167.463.[N04664]Stormy Sea with Dolphinsc.183540THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (4664)Canvas, 35 3/4 \u00d7 48 (91 \u00d7 102)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (? 119, one of 36 each 4'0\" \u00d7 3'0\"; identified 1946 by probable number on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1948.Exh.New York 1966 (35); Cologne (60, repr.), Rome (61, repr.) and Warsaw (60, repr.) 19667; R.A. 19745 (501); Hague 19789 (xiii, repr. in colour); Paris 19834 (56, repr.); Birmingham 1984.Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 157, 188 n. 14; Gowing 1966, p. 45.Martin Davies suggests that this may be a sunrise scene, though a fire at sea, brighter than but analagous toStormy Sea with Blazing Wreck(No. 462 [N04658]), is another possibility.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 45386: Late Unfinished Sea Pieces,c. 183045THERE are two main problems about this group of works. The first is the question of dating: the dates adopted here are highly tentative and are based on the supposition that there is a logical progression from a more substantial, three-dimensional style to one that is more impressionistic and less solid, together with a feeling that Turner's colouring was perhaps at its strongest from the early to the mid 1830s. However, as will be noted, the compilers do not always agree on even the tentative datings given here. In any case, what may look like a less three-dimensional picture may in fact be merely a less finished picture.The second problem is that ofprovenanceand authenticity, in particular as it concerns smaller pictures outside the Turner Bequest, Nos. 47484, together with the somewhat similar works no longer accepted as genuine, Nos. 5558. That some such unfinished works escaped the Turner Bequest is certain, and a foundation is provided by those works that can be definitely or tentatively traced to John Pound, the son by her first marriage of Mrs Booth, Turner's mistress and housekeeper. In reviews of our first edition, exception was taken to some of our attributions by Luke Herrmann (Nos. 475, 478 and 484) and Jerrold Ziff (Nos. 480 and 481); interestingly, they do not agree. Of the works they doubt, No. 478 seems definitely to have been in the Pound sale at Christie's in 1865, while Nos. 480, 481 and 484 bear labels or are said to come from the Pound family.However, one should never let an apparently sound provenance stand in the way of one's judgment based on the visual evidence, and in this case there is one further element, the fact that, from 1848, for apparently the only time in his life, Turner employed an assistant, Francis Sherrell. According to Bernard Falk (1938, p. 213), whose reference is based on an obituary in theIsle of Thanet Gazettefor 23 September 1916, Turner gave Sherrell lessons in return for various services such as stretching hiscanvasesand running errands; John Gage (1969, p. 171) suggests that Sherrell may also have cleaned some of the pictures in Turner's studio at the instigation of the dealer Thomas Griffith, who was active in trying to obtain sales for Turner at this time.

Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.297.[N05517]Two Recumbent Nude Figures1828THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5517)Canvas, 68 3/4 \u00d7 98 1/8 (174\u00b75 \u00d7 249)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (? 269, 1 (ditto [Academy figure] very large size); see below); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Lit.Davies 1949, p. 164.In canvas, stretcher and mode of attachment this picture shares the characteristics of the group of works known to have been painted by Turner in Rome in 1828 (see p. 170).Although the second nude, on the left, is only faintly outlined and the painting could therefore be described as a single Academy figure, the identification with no. 269 on the 1854 Schedule is only tentative, particularly as it is in fact no larger than no. 268 [N02001] Academy figure which can be identified withVenus Reclining(No. 296). The more finished figure is in much the same pose, though in reverse, as Venus inVenus and Adonisofc.1803 (No. 150); the outlined figure, though in general a mirror image of the other, differs in that the head is apparently turned away in profile. The nose, chin and neck of the right-hand figure, the most solidly painted parts of the picture, are badly damaged.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Besidesdrawingsof Petworth, this book has a number of studies of Cockermouth Castle, also belonging to Lord Egremont who had commissioned Turner to paint him views of both Petworth and Cockermouth Castle (No. 108 [T03879]). A payment from Lord Egremont on 14 June 1810, recorded in Turner's Finance sketchbook (CXXII), probably refers to these two pictures.As Rothenstein and Butlin have pointed out, following on his experiments of using a white ground for the sky and the water in his Thames studies oncanvas, Turner now began to explore the possibilities of attaining a high key in his finished oils by using a white ground throughout (although the catalogue of the Wantage collection claims that the first picture Turner painted on a white ground wasWhalley Bridgeexhibited in 1811 (see No. 117)). Turner's experiments inwatercolour, in which he used the whitepaperas the means of lightening thetoneof his drawings by allowing it to show through transparent washes, may have encouraged him to try a similar process in oil. At any rate, the result was sufficiently novel to make the critic ofLa Belle Assembl\u00e9e(1810, i, p. 250) doubt that the picture was by Turner if it had not been for the information in the catalogue. He wrote: ... it was manifestly Mr. Turner's design to express the peculiar hue and pellucidness of objects seen through a medium of air, in other words to express the clearness of atmosphere. To effect this purpose it was necessary to select those dark material objects which serve as a foil to aerial lights and to produce atmosphere by their contrast. Mr. Turner has neglected to use these necessary foils and has thus made a confusion between aerial lights and the appropriate gloom of objects. Failing in this forcible opposition, without which a painter can never express atmosphere, the appearance of the picture is that of a mere flimsy daubing without substance or distinction, without either shape or colour. A man of Mr. Turner's experience should have understood better the principles of his art.However, other critics were more appreciative: thePublic Ledger and Daily Advertiserfor 9 May wrote:The chief excellence in this picture is the execution of the water, and the dewy vapour that floats through the vallies; the latter effect is most happily expressed and, apparently, by a very simple process, that of a kind of light scumbling and glazing; but we think some of the more prominent objects in the foreground want force, and a richer variety of tint.This notice was repeated, almost word for word, in theSt. James's Chroniclefor 810 May while theBritish Press, 13 June, considered it Another most beautiful landscape, in which the water is pre-eminent, for the excellence with which it is finished. In clearness and brilliancy, we have never seen it excelled. Later on, however, Turner is criticized for a remarkable blemish ... in the shadow of the boat in the water, which is stronger than the boat itself; thus, contrary to nature, making the shadow the object, and the object the shadow.As Patrick Youngblood observes, the west facade of Petworth, shown here, is almost featureless, so that Turner is forced to call upon every pictorial device at his disposal to rescue the composition from stagnation.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

More recently, however, John Gage has identified the subject as an illustration to Spenser'sFaery Queene. Charles Eastlake waspaintingan illustration to the same poem for Sir John Soane while Turner was with him in Rome in 18289 (repr. Gage,op. cit., fig. 47), and in a letter to Eastlake of 11 August 1829 Turner writes that he would have liked to have bought Benjamin West'sCave of Despair, sold with the contents of West's studio in May of that year, and lament I did not (repr. Gage,op. cit., fig. 49). According to Gage, Turner, rather than illustrate any one passage, conflates elements from Cantos VIII and IX: Despair, seen in a cave inhabited by an owl, as in Canto IX, is urging the Red Cross Knight to kill himself with a dagger, partly because he has deserted Una and transferred his allegiance to the witch Duessa, whom Una is shown revealing in the right foreground as a loathly, wrinckeled hag, an incident which takes place in a different cave in Canto VIII; the hour-glasses illustrate the lines in Canto XI, verse 46, when Despair tries to persuade the Knight that it is better to die willinglie, Then linger till the glas be all out-ronne. Turner had already illustrated Spenser in one of theLiber Studiorumplates, R. 36, From Spenser's Fairy Queen, published in June 1811 (repr. Finberg 1924, p. 143; see also No. 439 [N00561]). However, the central figure identified by Gage as the Red Cross Knight is remarkably difficult to make out.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 28291 : Petworth Landscapes,c.182830THESE fall into two groups, plus the separatepaintingrelating to the two versions ofChichester Canal(No. 282 [N05563]). The first group consists of the five works from the Turner Bequest now in the Tate Gallery (Nos. 2837); the second of the four rather more finished pictures still at Petworth (Nos. 28891). These latter works originally hung below full-length seventeenth-centuryportraitsin the Grinling Gibbons panelled dining-room, and are more or less closely based on four of the Tate Gallery pictures, at least one of which seems originally to have hung in the place later occupied by one of the more finished pictures.Although Turner had painted a view of Petworth House in 1810 (No. 113 [T03880]) and had sold a considerable number of pictures to Lord Egremont, he became a more frequent visitor to Petworth after the death of his father in 1829. In particular it is known that he stayed there from December 1830 to January 1831. Nearly all recent writers on Turner have followed Finberg in assuming that it was then that thelandscapeswere painted, or at least begun. On the other hand, Collins Baker dates themc.182930, with the exception of theBrighton, which he assigns definitely to 1830. MacColl, following earlier National Gallery catalogues, dates the sketches forPetworth ParkandChichester Canal(Nos. 283 [N00559] and 285 [N00560]) to 1829. Thornbury dates thePetworth Parkeven earlier, 1828.In fact, the first known reference to the landscapes occurs in a letter from Thomas Creevey to Miss Ord of 18 August 1828, giving an account of his visit to Petworth on 1617 August. After describing the sixty foot dining room with its full-length portraits, he goes on, Immense as these pictures are with all their garniture there are still panels to spare, and as he [Lord Egremont] always has artists ready in the house, in one of these compartments, you have Petworth Park by Turner, in another Lord Egremont taking a walk with nine dogs, that are his constant companions, by the same artist ... The second of the pictures mentioned must be the Tate Gallery'sPetworth Park: Tillington Church in the Distance(No. 283 [N00559]), the dogs in which are omitted from the more finished version at Petworth (No. 288 [T03883]). The other picture is presumably the Tate'sLake, Petworth, Sunset(No. 284 [N02701]), unless the more finished version (No. 289 [T03884]) was alreadyin situ.John Gage has recently discovered that Turner was at Petworth in August 1827, and the landscapes may have been begun then. On the other hand, Gage has also suggested that the Tate Gallery pictures were begun in London and rejected because they turned out to be too large (1969, p. 260 n. 91), but Creevey's report makes this highly unlikely unless the pictures he saw were somehow only temporarily superimposed on the panels. In any case, the Tate pictures are not consistently larger than the final versions. It may therefore be that Lord Egremont, whose collection had hitherto been confined to Turner's earlier style, found the first set of pictures too sketchy in style; the history ofPalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]) suggests another instance of Lord Egremont failing to appreciate Turner's mature work.That Turner painted some if not all of the Petworth landscapes in the studio specially provided for him in the house is suggested by an anecdote in George Jones' manuscriptRecollections of Sir Francis Chantrey,written in 1849: When Turner painted a series of landscapes at Petworth, for the dining-room, he worked with his door locked against everybody but the master of the house. Chantrey was there at the time, and determined to see what Turner was doing; he imitated Lord Egremont's peculiar step, and the two distinct raps on the door by which his lordship was accustomed to announce himself: and the key being immediately turned, he slipped into the room before the artist could shut him out, which joke was mutually enjoyed by the two attached friends (reprinted in Finberg 1961, p. 325).Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 306; 1877, p. 439; Collins Baker 1920, pp. 1245; MacColl 1920, p. 27; John Gore (ed.),Creevey's life and Times: A Further Selection from the Correspondence of Thomas Creevey1934, p. 277; John Gore (ed.),Creevey1948, p. 293; Finberg 1961, p. 325; Herrmann 1975, pp. 34, 2312; Joll 1977, pp. 3749; Young-blood 1983, p. 16.291.[T03886]Brighton from the Seac.1829TATE GALLERY AND THE NATIONAL TRUST (LORD EGREMONT COLLECTION) PETWORTH HOUSECanvas, 25 \u00d7 52 (63\u00b75 \u00d7 132\u00b71)Coll.Painted for the third Earl of Egremont for the dining-room at Petworth; by descent to the third Lord Leconfield who in 1947 conveyed Petworth to the National Trust; in 1957 the contents of the State Rooms were accepted in part payment of death duties.Exh.R.A. 1894 (141); Tate Gallery 1951 (11); Whitechapel 1953 (85); Wildenstein 1954 (19).Engr.By R.

It was blown down in a gale in 1896 and vanished in a few months. Lord Egremont had a financial interest in the pier, being one of the original stockholders, which explains why it was chosen as a suitable subject to hang with the two views of Petworth Park. Turner may also have welcomed the opportunity to paint the Chain Pier because Constable had exhibited a picture of the subject at the R.A. in 1827 (186); this is now in the Tate Gallery (N05957).For dating of the four landscapes see no. 288 [T03883].This picture features in an anecdote, the outcome of which is the subject of conflicting stories. In his diary, the artist G. P. Boyce (182697) mentions a visit to Petworth in 1857. The relevant passage is as follows:June 30 at Petworth. The pictures by Turner are of the crude yellow sort. The Chain Pier at Brighton being the best. He introduced in the foreground of it a broken basket with some floating turnips, carrots etc. and as the old butler told me (who was in the house at the time and didn't relish the painter's uncouth manners) was savage when at Lord E's suggestion as to their specific gravity, he asked for a tub of water and some of the identical vegetables and found the latter all sank. They were evidently too useful in his picture to be removed.However, Thornbury in his account of the incident (1877, p. 308) confines the dispute to carrots alone (it is difficult to identify any of the vegetables in the picture as indisputable carrots) and records that when the bucket and carrots were brought Turner's affirmation that they would float was proved to be correct.It would seem from a simple experiment conducted by the compiler that Turner was in fact right and indubitably so if the carrots are released in the sea.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

An arrow meant for him goes astray and she is killed instead. Only one line of the ballad, 'She stood upon the castle wall', can be directly related to Sandys'spainting, which is more an imaginaryportraitof Oriana than an illustration of Tennyson's narrative. Sandys's main concern is clearly with the different textures of his sitter's skin, hair and brocade cloak, his minute scrutiny of which, and of thelandscapebackground, suggests an interest in fifteenth-century Flemish painting. Some years earlier Sandys had copied a portrait by Rogier van der Weyden (Frederick Sandys 1829-1904, exh. cat., Brighton Museum and Art Gallery 1974, no.10, pl.2) and he toured Belgium and Holland the year after painting 'Oriana'.The landscape background of the painting contains at least one reference to Sandys's native city of Norwich. The bridge is based on Bishop's Bridge, which also figures in 'Autumn' (Norwich Castle Museum; Brighton 1974, no.52, pl.24), a picture Sandys was probably working on at the same time as 'Oriana'.Brocades similar to the one used for Oriana's cloak appear in other early works by Sandys. His fascination with such materials may have been one of the reasons why his paintings appealed to the Clabburn family of Thorpe near Norwich, who were shawl manufacturers of some repute, winning gold medals in the international exhibitions of 1855 and 1862. 'Oriana' was in William Houghton Clabburn's sale in 1889 and had probably been bought by him when it first appeared at theAcademyin 1861. Sandys's only other exhibit that year was a portrait of Mrs Clabburn, painted in 1860 (Brighton 1974, no.84, pl.55). In 1861 he painted Mrs Clabburn senior, in 1869 drew her daughter-in-law again, in 1870 drew and painted Clabburn himself and subsequently drew his two sons (ibid., nos.85, 107, 108, 95, 109, 110 respectively, all repr.). At his death W.H. Clabburn's collection included numerous works by Sandys in addition to these family portraits. In the RA catalogues Sandys gave his own address as Thorpe between 1861 and 1865, thereafter reverting to a London address.Sandys presumably knew Holman Hunt's two illustrations to 'Oriana' in Moxon's 1857 edition of Tennyson sPoemsbut there is no thematic or stylistic connection between them and his painting. Lost sight of by scholars for some years before it reappeared at auction in 1984, 'Oriana' is one of a handful of paintings by Sandys of the late 1850s and early 186os that show his earliest, most 'hard-edged'Pre-Raphaelitestyle. From about 1862 Rossetti's influence becomes more apparent in his work.Published in:The Tate Gallery 1984-86: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions Including Supplement to Catalogue of Acquisitions 1982-84, Tate Gallery, London 1988, pp.80-1Read more",

Martin Davies describes this as a very early work but in fact it seems to have been worked on over a considerable period. The basic forms, and particularly the craggy hill in the centre, are close to suchpaintingsasThe Goddess of Discord choosing the Apple of Contention in the Garden of the HesperidesandFall of the Rhine at Schaffhausen, both exhibited in 1806 (Nos. 57 [N00477] and 61) but the impressionistic technique and the way in which the whole picture is illuminated by the apparition suggest a much later date, probably close to theVision of Medea(No. 293 [N00513]) which also reflects a return to earlier ideas and Venetian painting. The general effect owes much to Titian but the flicked-in forms of the angels are still closer to Tintoretto.John Gage has kindly drawn the compiler's attention to a passage in the Catalogue of the Pictures Bequeathed to ... Dulwich in theAnnals of the Fine Arts, i, 1817, pp. 387 ff., referring to the picture ofJacob's Dreamthen attributed to Rembrandt: Instead of a material ladder of substantial steps, on which well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, with wings on their shoulders, have been walking up and down like waiters ... we behold a mysterious, solemn twilight, on which from a bright refulgence in the heavens, a stream of light beams an immensity from earth to heaven .... This description could have pointed the way to Turner's own magical treatment of the subject. Washington Allston had painted a picture of the same subject for Lord Egremont in 1817, exhibiting it at the RoyalAcademyin 1819 and again at the British Institution in 1825.Since the first edition of this catalogue Jerrold Ziff has suggested that the first stage of this painting was even earlier than here suggested,c.18002 and that its intended subject may have been the first Plague of Egypt, the subject of adrawinginscribed Water Turned to Blood in the Calais Pier sketchbook (LXXXI-42 and 43); the size is close to that ofThe Fifth Plague of Egypt, exhibited in 1800 (No. 13). Shanes has suggested rather that the underlying picture is the lostArmy of the Medes destroyed in the Desart by a Whirlwind, exhibited in 1801 (No. 15).This painting not only shared the general neglect of most of the works kept in Turner's studio but was even turned to the wall and used as an impromptu palette. The dabs of paint were only removed when the picture was restored at the Tate Gallery in the 1970s.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Finberg's theory rested on his belief that the Studies for Pictures; Isleworth sketchbook, containing the watercolour study for the oil, dates from 181112. On the inside cover of the book is written:J.M.W. TurnerSion Ferry HouseIsleworth.and Finberg suggests that Turner moved there when he left Hammersmith in 1811 while he was waiting for Solus Lodge, Twickenham, to be got ready. While it is true that this sketchbook contains drawings connected with pictures such asMercury and Herse(No. 114, R.A. 1811) andDido and \u00c6neas(No. 129, R.A. 1814), it also has details of bank notes in use in 1804, which implies that the sketchbook, like many others, was in use over a number of years.Rothenstein and Butlin date this picturec.1805 and see in it a sign of Turner's early interest in a moreclassicalform ofcomposition, based mainly on forms lying parallel to the picture surface, and they cite a number of points of similarity withThe Garden of the Hesperides(No. 57, exh. 1806). There is also an echo of Gaspard Poussin and another close parallel in Turner's own work is to be found in theNarcissus and Echoof 1804 (No. 53 [T03869]), also at Petworth. On stylistic grounds, therefore, there seems to be a strong case for accepting a date ofc.1805.The dating proposed by Rothenstein and Butlin has received strong support from Patrick Youngblood's discovery that Turner was first rated for Sion Ferry House on 23 May 1805, thus six months earlier than his letter, written from the house, to Colt Hoare which has hitherto been the first proof of his occupancy (Youngblood 1982, p. 34 n.9).Therefore there seems no reason why the most obvious explanation should not be correct: that Turner painted, signed and sold the picture all in about 1805 or 1806. The unusual form of signature implies that Turner was living at Isleworth when he signed it at the time that Lord Egremont bought the picture. There is also a possibility that Turner exhibited it at his own gallery in 1805 or 1806. Certainly the evidence for a dating at about this time now seems overwhelming.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Turner had passed through it on his way to Portsmouth in October 1807 to watch the arrival of Stanhope's squadron after the surrender of the Danish fleet at Copenhagen (see No. 80, [N00481] also exhibited at Turner's gallery in 1808 but in an unfinished state).The figures in the left foreground are engaged in barking chestnut branches for caulking and tanning, an activity that was practised on Lord Egremont's estates, which included the Forest of Bere. In introducing these figures engaged thus into his picture, Turner may have hoped that this would recommend it to Lord Egremont. If so, his ingenuity succeeded, for the purchase of this picture by Lord Egremont was reported in theExamineron 8 May 1808. Despite thepaintinggoing straight from Turner's gallery to Petworth, it was soon shorn of its exhibition title but there can be no doubt at all of its identification after reading John Landseer's (?) detailed description of it in theReview of Publications of Artfor June 1808.Landseer praised the picture warmly, writing that Though it is nothing as a subject, it is everything as a picture, relying for its effect on the rich and harmonious union of its parts. He concluded Cuyp has long enjoyed a well-deserved celebrity, for making a few cattle and a setting sun the subject of an admirable picture. The pride of Cuyp... would be humbled, we conceive, by a too near approach to this picture of Turner.In fact, the picture shows signs of the influence of Rubens'landscapes, which Turner was to criticise in one of his lectures as taking liberties with lighting which destroyed the simplicity, the truth, the beauty of pastoral nature. Besides Rubens, there are also strong affinities with Gainsborough in the picture, which, however, remains one of Turner's most unaffected (as well as his most sylvan) paintings. It is thus characteristic of the moment it was painted, when landscape painting in England was on the threshold of a more naturalistic phase, which was to last throughout the coming decade. And, as the catalogue of the Turner Bicentenary Exhibition suggested, this return to nature in Turner's case may well have been the result of the experience of painting out-of-doors, an activity which Turner had recently been practising in his series of sketches of Thames subjects (see Nos. 16094).Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

It is perhaps the first example of a principle ofchiaroscurowhich Turner continued to develop in the 1820s and 1830s as peculiarly his own; and it is an early, possible the earliest, example of an overall spread of light of the type recognised by Turner in Veronese'sMarriage at Cana. It was just at this moment that Turner was preparing his Backgrounds lecture, in the series he delivered in 1812 as Professor ofPerspective, in which he pays especial attention to an analysis of Veronese's colour (see also No. 114). Gage's observations about Turner developing the principle of chiaroscuro, shown inTeignmouth, in the 1820s and 1830s, are also applicable to the colour and handling in certain areas, notably the foreground, where there are passages which come close to much later canvases such asThe Evening Star(see No. 453 [N01991]).Collins Baker transcribed the signature as J M W Turner 1812 but this is no longer legible. The picture suffered badly when the original and lining canvases became detached about 1957, causing blistering and corrugations. The work of recovery and restoration undertaken by Mr John Brealey, although involving a good deal of repainting in the sky, has done much to reveal anew the picture's extraordinary beauty.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 17794: Small Thames Sketchesc.1807THESE eighteen sketches of various sizes, painted on mahogany veneer, are all from the Turner Bequest. They were included in the 1854 Schedule as Nos. 184 to 200*, 18 fragments various sizes on Veneers\u2014or thinpanels; in the 1856 Schedule no. 200* [N05534], was inadvertently omitted. They were first numbered, laid down on panels, cleaned and exhibited in 1908 and 1910.The identifiable subjects of these sketches are all on the Thames or its tributary the Wey; several of the Guildford and Godalming views were identified in 1970 by Christopher Pinsent, including No. 186 [N02309], formerly thought to show Windsor Castle. The same area, with the exception of Walton Bridges, is covered bydrawingsin the Windsor, Eton sketchbook and the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVII and XCVIII).The small Thames sketches on panel, like these two sketchbooks, were datedc.1807 by Finberg (1909, i, pp. 251, 253, and 1961, p. 137), a date that still seems most probable. However, in 1969 Gage divided the sketches into three groups and dated them all later. His first group, Nos. 17980 [N02308,N02306], 183 [N02305], 18792 and 194 [N02311], he associates with the Wey, Guildford sketchbook but datesc.180910. His second group, Nos. 184 [N02680] and 185 [N02681], he datesc.181112. His third group comprises Nos. 177 [N02312], 178 [N02678], 181 [N02313], 182 [N02679] and 186 [N02309] and is dated by him toc.1813 or even later, on account of a supposed similarity to the foliage ofCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]), and a greater accomplishment than the small oil sketches onpaperof Devonshire subjects done in 1813 (Nos. 21325). The Devonshire sketches, however, are not strictly comparable in either technique or general approach, and again it seems more likely that, as is argued in the case of the large Thames sketches oncanvas(Nos. 160176), the whole group represents a single campaign playing a crucial part in the rapid development of Turner's approach to nature in the exhibited pictures of 1807 and 1808. Indeed, in 1983 (exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789 no. 20), Gage dated No. 186 toc.1807 and conceded that Turner seemed to have ceasedpaintingthe small Thames sketches on mahogany veneer by about 1811.These sketches were probably done out-of-doors, perhaps from a small boat as the younger Trimmer described, even though he talks of Turner using a large canvas (see p. 116). In them Turner approaches nearest to what Constable termed a natural painter, but, unlike Constable, Turner always seems to have been interested in making a complete pictorialcompositioneven when he came closest to recording a direct experience of nature.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 368; Clark 1949, pp. 989; Finberg 1961, pp. 1367; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, p. 77; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 234; Gage 1965, p. 75 n. 2; Gage 1969, p. 38; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 1619, 228; Wilton 1979, pp. 11118; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789.194.[N02311]Sunset on the Riverc.1807THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2311)Mahogany, 6 1/16 \u00d7 7 5/16 (15\u00b75 \u00d7 18\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (one of 184200*); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1910.Exh.Norwich and V. and A. 196970 (39, repr. p. 21); R.A. 19745 (137).Lit.Davies 1946, p. 189 n. 19; Gage 1969, p. 38.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Horse- and donkey-mills as seen in the background were used for grinding large quantities of cheap pigments such as ochres, siennas and umbers, used by decorators and artists. These feature in virtually all his oil paintings and in many earlier watercolours too.The colourman himself is grinding a quantity of red pigment into oil, using a heavy muller. It took half a day to grind a reasonable quantity. He would have put the paint into bladders of the type seen in Turners tin paintbox, for purchase by artists. In fact the red pigment is simple red ochre that could have come from the donkey-mill: Turner has painted it over a bright white ground to emulate the brilliance of vermilion.

The scene is probably somewhere in the Thames Estuary.Gage (exh. cat., Paris 19834, p. 82 no. 23) dates this workc.1809 because of its similarity toBlythe-Sands(No. 87). This dating would presumably also apply to the similar sketch ofShipping at the Mouth of the Thames(No. 175 [N02702]) but there are arguments for dating this whole group of Thames sketches on canvas toc.18067 as here; see the introduction to this section. In addition, Turner was exhibiting scenes on the Thames estuary from 1807 onwards and it seems more likely that all of these, even those that are more conventional and complex in design, stemmed from the experience represented in the sketches on canvas.[from]Nos. 16076: Large Thames Sketchesc.18067THIS group of seventeen sketches oncanvasfrom the Turner bequest, though carried to different degree of finish, are all similar in technique, being lightly painted over a dry chalky ground, and are all roughly similar in size save forSketch for Harvest Dinner, Kingston Bank, which measures only 24 \u00d7 36 in. (No. 160 [N02696]). This last was used for thepaintingexhibited at Turner's gallery in 1809 and again in 1810 (No. 90 [N00491]). Others are more loosely related to finished oil paintings exhibited in 1808, 1809 and 1810. A number of them are also related todrawingsin the Thames from Reading to Walton sketchbook, datablec.1806 (XCV; pp. 223 are sketches for the pictures of Walton Bridges, paid for early in 1807, see Nos. 60 and 63);c.f.for example pp. 31 and 37 with No. 173 [N02699], and p. 35 with No. 172 [N02706]; there is a different view of Goring Church, the subject of No. 161 [N02704], on p. 19. Thecompositionof one example,Trees beside a River, with a Bridge in the Middle Distance(No. 169 [N02692]), is very close to a drawing in the rather earlier Studies for Pictures; Isleworth sketchbook, sandwiched between lists ofclassicaland Biblical subjects (XC-55versoand 56): for the evidence for dating this sketchbookc.18045 see Nos. 149 [T03870] and 169 [N02692].There is reason to suppose that, contrary to Turner's usual practice, some if not all of these sketches were at least begun out-of-doors. Thornbury prints some reminiscences of the son of Turner's oldest friend the Rev. Mr. Trimmer, who had been out fishing with Turner when a child. He had a boat at Richmond ... From his boat he painted on a large canvas direct from Nature. Till you have seen these sketches, you know nothing of Turner's powers. There are about two score of these large subjects, rolled up, and now national property ... There is a red sunset (simply the sky) among the rolls. The last, probably the sadly darkenedSunset(No. 525 [N01876]), is different in character from the works under discussion and is probably later, but the folded and battered condition of many of the Thames sketches such as Nos. 171[N02703] and 173 [N02699] supports the identification with the works mentioned by Trimmer, as does the fact that the sketches seem to have been unstretched when they came to be relined early this century; indeed, some if not all may never have been stretched, No. 167 [N02705] for instance showing none of the usual pulling at the edges from the nails attaching a canvas to a stretcher. As in the case of two later groups of sketches on canvas, those painted in the Isle of Wight in 1827 (Nos. 260268 [N01995-N02001]) and those done in Rome 18289 (Nos. 302317), Turner may have painted on rolls of canvas, working them over a frame to use different areas as required. If these sketches were always on loose canvases they may have been the Roll of 17 separate Canvasses, nos. 219 to 235 in the inventory of the Turner Bequest. All but one were first numbered, restored and put on public exhibition in 1910; No. 165 [N05519], which is in considerably worse condition, was not even numbered until 1944.Though Turner did not complete his own cottage at Twickenham, across the river from Richmond, until 1813, he already had a second home at Isleworth, not that much further from Richmond, by 23 May 1805 (see Youngbloodop. cit., p. 34 n. 9), and at Upper Mall, Hammersmith probably from late 1806 until 1811, and he could well have had a boat at Richmond during all this period. John Gage suggested in 1969 that this group of sketches was executed over a number of years from about 1807 to as late asCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]); however in 1983 he accepted our dating for two of the sketches made on the Thames above London although dating one of the Thames estuary sketches (No. 176,q.v[N02698].) toc.1809. It is difficult to be sure of Turner's methods but the evidence of the sketchbooks and also of the groups of oil sketches that he is known to have painted on rolls of canvas, at Cowes in 1827 (Nos. 2608 [N01995-N02001]) and in and around Rome in 1828 (Nos. 30217) suggest that he was more likely to execute a whole run of sketches, varying in execution and degree of finish to a considerable extent, in a short time than to spread such series over periods of years. It seems likely therefore that Turner only used this rather unusual size and technique for this sort of sketch as a limited experiment.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Her loquacity, however, displeased Jupiter; and she was deprived of the power of speech by Juno and only permitted to answer the questions which were put to her. After she had been punished by Juno, Echo fell in love with Narcissus and on being despised by him she pined away, and was changed into a stone, which still retained the power of voice.Exhibited with the following lines:\u201cSo melts the youth, and languishes away;His beauty withers, and his limbs decay;And none of those attractive charms remainTo which the slighted Echo sued in vain.She saw him in his present misery,Whom, spite of all her wrongs, she griev'd to see:She answer'd sadly to the lover's moan,Sigh'd back his sighs, and groan'd to every groan:Ah! youth beloved in vain! Narcissus cries;Ah! youth beloved in vain! the nymph replies.Farewell! says he. The parting sound scarce fellFrom his faint lips, but she reply'd Farewell!\u201dRothenstein and Butlin suggest the quotation which accompanied the picture at the R.A. may possibly be by Turner himself. They were evidently unaware, as Gage points out (1969), that Turner had in fact made use of Addison's translation of Ovid'sMetamorphoses(Book iii ll. 60112). That the quotation was a translation from Ovid was, however, noticed by the critic of theStar(see below).The picture was still in Turner's possessionc.1810, for in the Finance sketchbook (CXXII) it is listed with its value apparently written down, presumably because it was still unsold. The list is on a page opposite one which refers to a date in November 1809 but it must have been drawn up rather later (the sketchbook includes references to dates as late as 1814) as theNarcissusis lumped together with Cows (Abingdon/Dorchester Mead?), Richmond and Ploughing (presumablySlough(No. 89)). AsSloughandDorchester Mead(No. 107 [N00485]) were exhibited in 1809 and 1810 respectively, it seems unlikely that Turner would have written down their value straightaway. Finberg interprets Turner's notes, which bracket these four pictures together for \u00a3200, to mean that Turner had revalued them for stock-taking purposes at \u00a350 each, but it is also possible (although I consider it less likely after studying Turner's calculations) that he meant to indicate that this quartet belonged to the category which was normally priced \u00a3200 each. If Finberg's theory is correct, then it seems that Egremont may have been tempted to buy it by the reduction in price.To judge from another note in the Farnley sketchbook (CLIII) aboutengravingsto be published in theLiber Studiorumon 1 January 1819, Lord Egremont must have owned the picture by this date if Finberg is correct in identifying Lord Egremont's picture with theNarcissus. The note shows that it was intended that W. Say should engrave it but in fact only three out of the eight titles listed by Turner as Liber Studiorum Plates out Jan 1 1819 were in fact published on that date.Ruskin described it as the firstclassicalsubject painted by Turner but Gage suggests that another source may have been an idea of George Field's, that reflection in colour might be compared to echo in sound, and it is agreeable to this analogy, thatEchowas feigned to have pined forNarcissus. In any case the influence of Gaspard Poussin is paramount in the picture's composition, although the experience of the large Welshwatercoloursis also evident.When the picture was shown at the R.A. the critic of theBritish Pressfor 3 May wrote We acknowledge the great beauty of this picture is thelandscape... yet the story is gracefully told ... This picture will bear much critical examination; while its general effect is extremely beautiful, and ranks it in a very high class.TheStarfor 10 May also praised it with reservations, although it said the picture was too affectedly imitative of the manner of a foreign school and also that Here again we have another long translation from Ovid, to point out that in the picture which without it would never have been found.TheSunfor the same date, however, found the picture full of faults, saying that if the artist had not told us the subject it would have been impossible for the most penetrating intellect to have discovered it. There are more figures introduced than might be expected in such a scene and, except Narcissus, they all appear likeStatuesthat had fallen from their places. The general aspect of the colouring is likeclayand thetreesare much of the same hue asboiled vegetables. A part of the mountain is so strangely detached from the body, that it seems to beflying stonewhich dropped some years ago in Yorkshire.When discussing the exhibition at the British Institution in 1806, Thomas Daniell told Farington that the room was too dark and that Turner'sEchoandHesperian Fruit(see No. 57, [N00477]) looked like old tapestries.It seems likely that Turner was attracted to the subject by seeing Claude's picture ofNarcissus and Echo(dating from 1644 and now in the National Gallery, London, no. 19). The Claude belonged to Sir George Beaumont by 1790 and hung in his house in London from then until being taken to Coleorton, Beaumont's house in Leicestershire, in 1808. Although Beaumont was later to become a hostile critic of Turner's work, he and Turner seem to have been on reasonably friendly terms in the late 1790s and Turner would certainly have known Beaumont's collection.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

The evidence is only circumstantial although the fact that pictures of Thames scenery had been exhibited by Turner previously is confirmed by John Landseer's (?) review of the 1808 exhibition (Review of Publication of Arts) in which he says The greater number of the pictures at present exhibited are views on the Thames, whose course Mr. Turner has now studiously followed... almost from its source to where it mingles its waters with those of the German Ocean, including the pictures of Thames scenery which Mr. Turner has formerly exhibited.In any case, a dating ofc.1807 would seem perfectly acceptable on stylistic grounds although it is difficult to be certain about this in view of the picture's present condition. The paint has certainly darkened with time and the surface has suffered maltreatment from a past relining. The left-hand lower corner in the area of the two boats has suffered particularly but the water is also restored in a number of areas. Waagen noted that the picture breathes a soft melancholy, and gives an effect which may be classed between Claude and Van der Neer. Much of this atmospheric effect has now sadly disappeared.There is a preparatorydrawingfor thecomposition, as Ziff has noted, on p. 30 of the Hesperides (1) sketchbook (XCIII).Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

They were included in the 1854 Schedule as Nos. 184 to 200*, 18 fragments various sizes on Veneers\u2014or thinpanels; in the 1856 Schedule no. 200* [N05534], was inadvertently omitted. They were first numbered, laid down on panels, cleaned and exhibited in 1908 and 1910.The identifiable subjects of these sketches are all on the Thames or its tributary the Wey; several of the Guildford and Godalming views were identified in 1970 by Christopher Pinsent, including No. 186 [N02309], formerly thought to show Windsor Castle. The same area, with the exception of Walton Bridges, is covered bydrawingsin the Windsor, Eton sketchbook and the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVII and XCVIII).The small Thames sketches on panel, like these two sketchbooks, were datedc.1807 by Finberg (1909, i, pp. 251, 253, and 1961, p. 137), a date that still seems most probable. However, in 1969 Gage divided the sketches into three groups and dated them all later. His first group, Nos. 17980 [N02308,N02306], 183 [N02305], 18792 and 194 [N02311], he associates with the Wey, Guildford sketchbook but datesc.180910.

The Devonshire sketches, however, are not strictly comparable in either technique or general approach, and again it seems more likely that, as is argued in the case of the large Thames sketches oncanvas(Nos. 160176), the whole group represents a single campaign playing a crucial part in the rapid development of Turner's approach to nature in the exhibited pictures of 1807 and 1808. Indeed, in 1983 (exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789 no. 20), Gage dated No. 186 toc.1807 and conceded that Turner seemed to have ceasedpaintingthe small Thames sketches on mahogany veneer by about 1811.These sketches were probably done out-of-doors, perhaps from a small boat as the younger Trimmer described, even though he talks of Turner using a large canvas (see p. 116). In them Turner approaches nearest to what Constable termed a natural painter, but, unlike Constable, Turner always seems to have been interested in making a complete pictorialcompositioneven when he came closest to recording a direct experience of nature.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 368; Clark 1949, pp. 989; Finberg 1961, pp. 1367; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, p. 77; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 234; Gage 1965, p. 75 n. 2; Gage 1969, p. 38; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 1619, 228; Wilton 1979, pp. 11118; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789.193.[N02307]On the Thames?c.1807THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2307)Mahogany veneer, 11 5/8 \u00d7 13 3/4 (29\u00b75 \u00d7 35); a wedgeshaped area lower left, 9 \u00d7  3/4 (23 \u00d7 2), has been restored.Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (one of 184200*); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1968.Exh.Tate Gallery 1931 (67).Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 155, 189 n. 19; 1959, pp. 1012.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

(No. 160 [N02696]). This last was used for thepaintingexhibited at Turner's gallery in 1809 and again in 1810 (No. 90 [N00491]). Others are more loosely related to finished oil paintings exhibited in 1808, 1809 and 1810. A number of them are also related todrawingsin the Thames from Reading to Walton sketchbook, datablec.1806 (XCV; pp. 223 are sketches for the pictures of Walton Bridges, paid for early in 1807, see Nos. 60 and 63);c.f.for example pp. 31 and 37 with No. 173 [N02699], and p. 35 with No. 172 [N02706]; there is a different view of Goring Church, the subject of No. 161 [N02704], on p. 19. The composition of one example,Trees beside a River, with a Bridge in the Middle Distance(No. 169 [N02692]), is very close to a drawing in the rather earlier Studies for Pictures; Isleworth sketchbook, sandwiched between lists ofclassicaland Biblical subjects (XC-55versoand 56): for the evidence for dating this sketchbookc.18045 see Nos. 149 [T03870] and 169 [N02692].There is reason to suppose that, contrary to Turner's usual practice, some if not all of these sketches were at least begun out-of-doors. Thornburyprintssome reminiscences of the son of Turner's oldest friend the Rev. Mr. Trimmer, who had been out fishing with Turner when a child. He had a boat at Richmond ... From his boat he painted on a large canvas direct from Nature. Till you have seen these sketches, you know nothing of Turner's powers. There are about two score of these large subjects, rolled up, and now national property ... There is a red sunset (simply the sky) among the rolls. The last, probably the sadly darkenedSunset(No. 525 [N01876]), is different in character from the works under discussion and is probably later, but the folded and battered condition of many of the Thames sketches such as Nos. 171[N02703] and 173 [N02699] supports the identification with the works mentioned by Trimmer, as does the fact that the sketches seem to have been unstretched when they came to be relined early this century; indeed, some if not all may never have been stretched, No. 167 [N02705] for instance showing none of the usual pulling at the edges from the nails attaching a canvas to a stretcher. As in the case of two later groups of sketches on canvas, those painted in the Isle of Wight in 1827 (Nos. 260268 [N01995-N02001]) and those done in Rome 18289 (Nos. 302317), Turner may have painted on rolls of canvas, working them over a frame to use different areas as required. If these sketches were always on loose canvases they may have been the Roll of 17 separate Canvasses, nos. 219 to 235 in the inventory of the Turner Bequest. All but one were first numbered, restored and put on public exhibition in 1910; No. 165 [N05519], which is in considerably worse condition, was not even numbered until 1944.Though Turner did not complete his own cottage at Twickenham, across the river from Richmond, until 1813, he already had a second home at Isleworth, not that much further from Richmond, by 23 May 1805 (see Youngbloodop. cit., p. 34 n. 9), and at Upper Mall, Hammersmith probably from late 1806 until 1811, and he could well have had a boat at Richmond during all this period. John Gage suggested in 1969 that this group of sketches was executed over a number of years from about 1807 to as late asCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]); however in 1983 he accepted our dating for two of the sketches made on the Thames above London although dating one of the Thames estuary sketches (No. 176,q.v[N02698].) toc.1809. It is difficult to be sure of Turner's methods but the evidence of the sketchbooks and also of the groups of oil sketches that he is known to have painted on rolls of canvas, at Cowes in 1827 (Nos. 2608 [N01995-N02001]) and in and around Rome in 1828 (Nos. 30217) suggest that he was more likely to execute a whole run of sketches, varying in execution and degree of finish to a considerable extent, in a short time than to spread such series over periods of years. It seems likely therefore that Turner only used this rather unusual size and technique for this sort of sketch as a limited experiment.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 169; 1877, pp. 12021; MacColl 1920, pp. 3840; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, pp. 778; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 246; Gage 1969, pp. 378; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 229; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood, 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 779.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Display captionThe sea and sky were both worked in first with unmodified oil paint. The sky was developed with thin broken washes of opaque paint, called scumbles. Turner worked up the buildings with paint applied with a palette knife, then smoothed it with a brush. Elsewhere he thinned the paint considerably, probably with oil of turpentine. This evaporates to give matte paint, necessarily in a thin layer, which contrasts with the naturally glossier unthinned paint used to make impasto (texture). The process took several days, since the impasted paint overlies partially-dried paint.Years later, the sky was damaged in Turners studio, perhaps by water or even rain, and some paint flaked off. Turner reworked the sky with bodied paint  that is, paint that retains impasto, perhaps a megilp  using yellow barium chromate, not available before 1843. He used the end of his brush to enliven the surface, leaving characteristic straight marks in the paint.Gallery label, February 2010Does this text contain inaccurate information or language that you feel we should improve or change?We would like to hear from you.Read more",

The works were freely painted on a continuous roll of canvas, tacked onto a small stretcher.The location represented in this painting is unidentified but the hazy blue background, the aqueduct or bridge in the centre, and the tree dominating the right hand foreground, are all elements inspired by classical Italianate compositions.

    "description": "Technique and conditionThe exact date of the painting is unknown but records show that the Earl of Egremont bought the painting in 1808, most likely direct from Turners studio.  It was executed on a single piece of linen canvas with a simple 1 x1 open weave pattern.  Visual examination and cross section analysis can not confirm the presence of a lining.  If there is priming, it is extremely thin, not white, and does not cover the support completely.  The canvas is visible in many areas where the paint layers do not cover the canvas fibres. There are also many pinpoint holes where the interstices in the linen have not been bridged by the fluid paint.  These appear as tiny dark spots in the lighter coloured areas. The linen was stretched over an eight member softwood stretcher with corner braces and attached with ferrous tacks around the outside edge.  The stretcher is expandable with double keyed, non-mitred, mortise and tenon joints.  Evidence suggests this is an original stretcher and therefore the first extent Turner stretcher with corner braces, previously stretchers of this type were only known from cracks in the painting.  Gummed paper tape was applied to the tacking margins and extends onto the reverse.No evidence exists of initial preparation or underdrawing.  The basic composition was blocked with paint onto the front face of the prepared canvas.  At this point, the painting was removed from the stretcher, the tacking margins were flattened and it was lined onto an open weave fabric, probably by the artist or his father. This expanded the size of the painting by approximately 30mm in all directions.  The lined canvas was then stretched onto the present stretcher and the painting completed.Oil paint was applied in several layers and varies in thickness and opacity.  The sky was executed in thin, smooth applications of colour that have little texture and do not obscure the canvas texture or cover areas of exposed canvas completely.  Conversely, the waves were built up using thicker paint resulting in an abundance of brushstrokes and impasto.  Most of the surface appears glossy.  After completion, the painting was varnished with an even application of natural resin varnish which saturates the paint and evens out gloss.Since its purchase, the painting has been displayed in the State Rooms at Petworth House. The painting is stable and in good condition overall.  The lining undoubtedly contributed to the present state of preservation, including the absence of stretcher bar cracks. Canvas tension is slack causing a bulge along the bottom, slight undulations across the surface and corner draws at upper right.  The painting exhibits a very fine network of general age cracks.  There are several areas in the sky where the edges of the cracks are starting to lift that should be monitored as they are vulnerable and may lead to future loss.  The natural resin varnish has yellowed and darkened slightly but it maintains an even gloss and still saturates the paint.  Front and back are covered with a moderate layer of dust.The painting was treated in the Tate Conservation Studio in January 2002.Julie SimekJanuary 2002Read more",

Thecompositionof one example,Trees beside a River, with a Bridge in the Middle Distance(No. 169 [N02692]), is very close to a drawing in the rather earlier Studies for Pictures; Isleworth sketchbook, sandwiched between lists ofclassicaland Biblical subjects (XC-55versoand 56): for the evidence for dating this sketchbookc.18045 see Nos. 149 [T03870] and 169 [N02692].There is reason to suppose that, contrary to Turner's usual practice, some if not all of these sketches were at least begun out-of-doors. Thornbury prints some reminiscences of the son of Turner's oldest friend the Rev. Mr. Trimmer, who had been out fishing with Turner when a child. He had a boat at Richmond ... From his boat he painted on a large canvas direct from Nature. Till you have seen these sketches, you know nothing of Turner's powers. There are about two score of these large subjects, rolled up, and now national property ... There is a red sunset (simply the sky) among the rolls. The last, probably the sadly darkenedSunset(No. 525 [N01876]), is different in character from the works under discussion and is probably later, but the folded and battered condition of many of the Thames sketches such as Nos. 171[N02703] and 173 [N02699] supports the identification with the works mentioned by Trimmer, as does the fact that the sketches seem to have been unstretched when they came to be relined early this century; indeed, some if not all may never have been stretched, No. 167 [N02705] for instance showing none of the usual pulling at the edges from the nails attaching a canvas to a stretcher. As in the case of two later groups of sketches on canvas, those painted in the Isle of Wight in 1827 (Nos. 260268 [N01995-N02001]) and those done in Rome 18289 (Nos. 302317), Turner may have painted on rolls of canvas, working them over a frame to use different areas as required. If these sketches were always on loose canvases they may have been the Roll of 17 separate Canvasses, nos. 219 to 235 in the inventory of the Turner Bequest. All but one were first numbered, restored and put on public exhibition in 1910; No. 165 [N05519], which is in considerably worse condition, was not even numbered until 1944.Though Turner did not complete his own cottage at Twickenham, across the river from Richmond, until 1813, he already had a second home at Isleworth, not that much further from Richmond, by 23 May 1805 (see Youngbloodop. cit., p. 34 n. 9), and at Upper Mall, Hammersmith probably from late 1806 until 1811, and he could well have had a boat at Richmond during all this period. John Gage suggested in 1969 that this group of sketches was executed over a number of years from about 1807 to as late asCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]); however in 1983 he accepted our dating for two of the sketches made on the Thames above London although dating one of the Thames estuary sketches (No. 176,q.v[N02698].) toc.1809. It is difficult to be sure of Turner's methods but the evidence of the sketchbooks and also of the groups of oil sketches that he is known to have painted on rolls of canvas, at Cowes in 1827 (Nos. 2608 [N01995-N02001]) and in and around Rome in 1828 (Nos. 30217) suggest that he was more likely to execute a whole run of sketches, varying in execution and degree of finish to a considerable extent, in a short time than to spread such series over periods of years. It seems likely therefore that Turner only used this rather unusual size and technique for this sort of sketch as a limited experiment.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 169; 1877, pp. 12021; MacColl 1920, pp. 3840; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, pp. 778; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 246; Gage 1969, pp. 378; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 229; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood, 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 779.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

However, they are not really at all close to thecompositionof the picture, and the connection between them, suggested by Finberg, seems most doubtful. Other drawings of hulks on a river are in the Devon Rivers sketchbook (CXXXIII), dated 181215 by Finberg. That on p. 28verso, listed by Finberg as Hulks in Plymouth Sound, resembles the oil more closely than the others, but cannot claim to be a study for it. Awatercolourin the Turner Bequest, although catalogued as Hulks on the Tamar (CXCVI-E, repr. in colour by Wilkinson 1974, p. 135), is also only marginally related, as Finberg recognised.Datedc.1811 by Collins Baker, there are traces of what may have been a date following the signature, but they are now indecipherable. Finberg suggests that this picture may be identified with the picture exhibited in Turner's gallery in 1812 as The River Plym, one of the seven newlandscapesmentioned in the review of the exhibition in theSunof 9 June (see No. 118). There is no evidence for this, and the traditional title may be thought to gainsay it. On the other hand, there is no trace at all of the pictureThe River Plymsince 1812 and the titles of Turner's pictures are often confused or changed with the passage of time. Instances of this among the Turners at Petworth have already been noted under No. 118. Lord Egremont would certainly have been familiar with the pictures exhibited in 1812 as he bought theTeignmouth(No. 120) shown that year. In any case, whether exhibited or not, this picture must date fromc.1812 on stylistic grounds. Similarities in thepaintingof the figures with those inSt Mawes(No. 123 [N00484]), for instance, are very close.According to the National Trust records, the condition of this picture must be assumed to be irrecoverable since it fell into the hands of an overzealous restorer in 1931. The surface is certainly now very much flattened and the subtle gradations oftoneand colour are no longer more than faintly discernible.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

In an undated letter he asked his father to send one or if possible two pieces of unstretchedcanvas, either a piece measuring 6 ft by 4 ft or a whole length, and it was on a 6 ft by 4 ft canvas, cut into two, that he painted these nine sketches. The 1854 Schedule of the Turner Bequest listed, under nos. 203 to 206, 207 to 210, 211 to 214, and 215 to 218, four Roll[s] containing 4 subjects. Despite the fact that one of the Cowes canvases contained five sketches the two rolls were probably among these four. They were rediscovered at the National Gallery in 1905 and divided into separate pieces. One roll contained Nos. 260 [N01995], 262 [N01993], 264 [N02000], 266 [N01996] and 268 [N02001] and the other Nos. 261 [N01994], 263 [N01998], 265 [N01997] and 267 [N01999].No record was made of the placing of the sketches on the two rolls on canvas, but to a certain extent this can be reconstructed. On the first roll the two largest sketches, Nos. 264 [N02000] and 262 [N01993], were one above the other, flanked on the left by Nos. 266 [N01996], 260 [N01995] (both upside down) and 268 [N02001]. On the other Nos. 267 [N01999] and 263 [N01998] were at the top, Nos. 265 [N01997] and 261 [N01994] below; No. 261 [N01994] was definitely to the right of No. 265 [N01997], and No. 267 [N01999] seems to have been above No. 265 [N01997].It has been suggested by Graham Reynolds that at least some of these sketches were painted on the spot, though the practical difficulties, especially when the artist was out at sea, would have been considerable. As Evelyn Joll has suggested, a clue as to where Turner may have done the sketches is given by the sketchBetween Decks(No. 266 [N01996]). This appears to have been painted a board a man-of-war and there seems no reason why Turner could not have painted the sketches of yachts racing from a ship anchored of Cowes Roads. If so, Turner's vantage point would seem to have been on a ship rather further offshore than the guardship that can be seen in Nos. 242, 261 [N01994] and 262 [N01993]. It is interesting that the three sketches forThe Regatta beating to Windwardwould seem to have been painted alternately on each roll, No. 260 [N01995] on the first, No. 261 [N01994] on the second, and No. 262 [N01993] again on the first; this could have been to allow an assistant time to adjust the roll for a new sketch.The Windsor and Cowes sketchbook (CCXXVI) containsdrawingsof boats racing, boats at anchor, views of the coast and figure studies, though none directly related to the oil sketches, which to a certain extent supports the suggestion that they were done on the spot. It also contains a list of the boats with their names, the names of their owners, and their colours, showing just how detailed was Turner's interest in the Regatta (CCXXVI-80verso).The two groups of sketches of the Regatta were used for the pictures commissioned by John Nash and exhibited the following year (see Nos. 242 and 243). The other three, includingBetween Decks, were not used for more finished pictures.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 313; Reynolds 19692, pp. 6772.262.[N01993]Sketch for East Cowes Castle, the Regatta beating to Windward no. 31827THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (1993)Canvas, 18 1/4 \u00d7 28 1/2 (46\u00b75 \u00d7 72)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (? one of 20318; see p. 159); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1954.Exh.New Zealand (4, repr.), Australia and South Africa (53) 19369; Paris 1938 (142, repr.); on loan to the National Gallery of Scotland 196472; Edinburgh 1968 (2); R.A. 19745 (313).Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 1545; Clare 1951, p. 75; repr. p. 70; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, p. 39; Reynolds 19692, pp. 6772; Herrmann 1975, p. 33, pl. 118.One of the five sketches painted on the first roll of canvas, and one of the three related to the finishedThe Regatta beating to Windward(No. 242). It is a slightly more distant view than the other two, and in its placing of the boats on the left and the distant guardship in the centre it is closer to the exhibited picture, though the boat in the right foreground is shown at a greater angle. East Cowes Castle can be seen against the sky to the left of the guardship. Rather more finished and balanced incompositionthan the other two related sketches, thispaintingwas perhaps at least finished back at East Cowes Castle.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 2608: Cowes Sketches, 1827[N01998-N02001]TURNER revisited the Isle of Wight in late July and August 1827, staying with the architect John Nash at East Cowes Castle. In an undated letter he asked his father to send one or if possible two pieces of unstretchedcanvas, either a piece measuring 6 ft by 4 ft or a whole length, and it was on a 6 ft by 4 ft canvas, cut into two, that he painted these nine sketches. The 1854 Schedule of the Turner Bequest listed, under nos. 203 to 206, 207 to 210, 211 to 214, and 215 to 218, four Roll[s] containing 4 subjects. Despite the fact that one of the Cowes canvases contained five sketches the two rolls were probably among these four. They were rediscovered at the National Gallery in 1905 and divided into separate pieces. One roll contained Nos. 260 [N01995], 262 [N01993], 264 [N02000], 266 [N01996] and 268 [N02001] and the other Nos. 261 [N01994], 263 [N01998], 265 [N01997] and 267 [N01999].No record was made of the placing of the sketches on the two rolls on canvas, but to a certain extent this can be reconstructed.

It seems to show a slightly earlier moment, the two boats in the right foreground not yet being quite so close to each other.

Twelve pictures are described in some detail, of which this is the second, referred to as Eton College. Landseer stresses the stately dignity of the picture and says this effect is maintained by the introduction of a group of swans. Not surprisingly the review quotes from Thomas Gray'sOde on a Distant Prospect of Eton College. Landseer ends his discussion of this picture by referring to the recently issued Prospectus for theLiber Studiorumand asking into which classification oflandscapeMr Turner would assign this picture.On 8 May theExaminerannounced the purchase by Lord Egremont ofThe Forest of Bere(No. 77 [T03875]) from Turner's gallery but, as Finberg points out, the exhibition had then only been running for a little over two weeks, and there is no reason why Lord Egremont should not have bought further pictures later in the course of the exhibition. Indeed, as four pictures in all of those shown in 1808 are now at Petworth, it seems more likely that he bought the other three during the course of the exhibition rather than after it closed, but there is no evidence about this either way.A number ofdrawingsof Eton occur in the Windsor, Eaton sketchbook (XCVII) but none is closely connected with thiscomposition.The figures in the punt on the left have a markedly Dutch look about them, deriving perhaps from the figures in Van Goyen's riverscapes. Turner was to introduce Van Goyen into the title of one of his exhibited pictures twenty-five years later (see No. 350).Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

(No. 160 [N02696]). This last was used for thepaintingexhibited at Turner's gallery in 1809 and again in 1810 (No. 90 [N00491]). Others are more loosely related to finished oil paintings exhibited in 1808, 1809 and 1810. A number of them are also related todrawingsin the Thames from Reading to Walton sketchbook, datablec.1806 (XCV; pp. 223 are sketches for the pictures of Walton Bridges, paid for early in 1807, see Nos. 60 and 63);c.f.for example pp. 31 and 37 with No. 173 [N02699], and p. 35 with No. 172 [N02706]; there is a different view of Goring Church, the subject of No. 161 [N02704], on p. 19. Thecompositionof one example,Trees beside a River, with a Bridge in the Middle Distance(No. 169 [N02692]), is very close to a drawing in the rather earlier Studies for Pictures; Isleworth sketchbook, sandwiched between lists ofclassicaland Biblical subjects (XC-55versoand 56): for the evidence for dating this sketchbookc.18045 see Nos. 149 [T03870] and 169 [N02692].There is reason to suppose that, contrary to Turner's usual practice, some if not all of these sketches were at least begun out-of-doors. Thornbury prints some reminiscences of the son of Turner's oldest friend the Rev. Mr. Trimmer, who had been out fishing with Turner when a child. He had a boat at Richmond ... From his boat he painted on a large canvas direct from Nature. Till you have seen these sketches, you know nothing of Turner's powers. There are about two score of these large subjects, rolled up, and now national property ... There is a red sunset (simply the sky) among the rolls. The last, probably the sadly darkenedSunset(No. 525 [N01876]), is different in character from the works under discussion and is probably later, but the folded and battered condition of many of the Thames sketches such as Nos. 171[N02703] and 173 [N02699] supports the identification with the works mentioned by Trimmer, as does the fact that the sketches seem to have been unstretched when they came to be relined early this century; indeed, some if not all may never have been stretched, No. 167 [N02705] for instance showing none of the usual pulling at the edges from the nails attaching a canvas to a stretcher. As in the case of two later groups of sketches on canvas, those painted in the Isle of Wight in 1827 (Nos. 260268 [N01995-N02001]) and those done in Rome 18289 (Nos. 302317), Turner may have painted on rolls of canvas, working them over a frame to use different areas as required. If these sketches were always on loose canvases they may have been the Roll of 17 separate Canvasses, nos. 219 to 235 in the inventory of the Turner Bequest. All but one were first numbered, restored and put on public exhibition in 1910; No. 165 [N05519], which is in considerably worse condition, was not even numbered until 1944.Though Turner did not complete his own cottage at Twickenham, across the river from Richmond, until 1813, he already had a second home at Isleworth, not that much further from Richmond, by 23 May 1805 (see Youngbloodop. cit., p. 34 n. 9), and at Upper Mall, Hammersmith probably from late 1806 until 1811, and he could well have had a boat at Richmond during all this period. John Gage suggested in 1969 that this group of sketches was executed over a number of years from about 1807 to as late asCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]); however in 1983 he accepted our dating for two of the sketches made on the Thames above London although dating one of the Thames estuary sketches (No. 176,q.v[N02698].) toc.1809. It is difficult to be sure of Turner's methods but the evidence of the sketchbooks and also of the groups of oil sketches that he is known to have painted on rolls of canvas, at Cowes in 1827 (Nos. 2608 [N01995-N02001]) and in and around Rome in 1828 (Nos. 30217) suggest that he was more likely to execute a whole run of sketches, varying in execution and degree of finish to a considerable extent, in a short time than to spread such series over periods of years. It seems likely therefore that Turner only used this rather unusual size and technique for this sort of sketch as a limited experiment.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 169; 1877, pp. 12021; MacColl 1920, pp. 3840; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, pp. 778; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 246; Gage 1969, pp. 378; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 229; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood, 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 779.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

These involved Turner in journeys in the summer of 1809 to gather material for these commissions. This material can be seen in the Petworth (CIX) and Cockermouth (CX) sketchbooks. In the former are a group ofdrawingsof Cockermouth Castle; p. 24 shows a careful study for the oil and is much closer to thecompositionof the picture than the drawing on p. 14 which Finberg identifies as the sketch for it. There is also a related drawing on p. 16 of the Cockermouth sketchbook among other views of the castle (in particular those on pp. 17 and 21). These drawings are much slighter and more rapidly executed than the detailed studies in the Petworth sketchbook.Cockermouth Castle was originally in the possession of the Earls of Northumberland and passed in 1750 with the Egremont title and Petworth to Sir Charles Wyndham (d.1763), nephew of the seventh Duke of Somerset and the father of Turner's patron.In the Hastings sketchbook (CXI), pp. 579 contain details of Turner's accounts, which include a note of payment from Lord Egremont on 15 June 1810. This probably refers to thePetworth from the Lake(No. 113 [T03880]) and to this picture. Finberg gives the price of the former as 200 guineas and of this picture as 100 guineas.It is interesting to note that although both pictures depict houses belonging to Lord Egremont and were painted in the same year, they were obviously not conceived aspendantsas in the case of the two views of Lowther Castle (Nos. 111 and 112) or the two pictures of Tabley already mentioned. As this picture is the same size asThe Thames at Eton(No. 71[T03873]), acquired by Lord Egremont in 1808, it seems likely that it was painted to these dimensions in order to hang as a pendant to theEton.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Some of these are inscribed in Turner's hand Ld. Egremont's Picture when he evidently went through the sketchbook in 1805 (a number ofdrawingsare inscribed: Study not painted 1805 which fixes the date). Further preparatory drawings occur in the Dolbadarn sketchbook (XLVI), on pp. 114, 115 and 118. There are some much slighter studies in the Studies for Pictures sketchbook (LXIX) pp. 2932, 40verso41, 91. In some cases the connection is clear, in others more tenuous. These drawings emphasise the care Turner took over the composition which, in its finished state, does perfectly illustrate the title, showing in detail ships sailing, coming up into the wind, shortening sail and dropping anchor. Professor Bachrach has drawn my attention to the similarity between the ship at anchor (although Turner has shown it as greatly elongated) and a model of a ship which Turner owned (now in the Tate Gallery).This picture attracted almost no attention when at the R.A., the critics concentrating mainly onThe Tenth Plague(No. 17 [N00470]) and after that onFishermen on a Lee-Shore(No. 16) and thewatercoloursof Scotland. The only paper to mention it was theDaily Advertiser and Oraclefor 5 May which wrote: That which struck us amidst the crowd and bustle which prevail at the first opening of theAcademyas the best, is a scene with ships beating up to gain anchorage. It is indeed a most forcible and judicious performance, well drawn and admirably coloured.Such neglect seems extraordinary after the attention paid to theBridgewater Seapiecethe previous year (see No. 14), especially as this great early masterpiece goes even beyond its predecessor in its dramatic rendering of a stormy sky and turbulent sea.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

By the end of the decade he had become an admirer of the Welsh artist Richard Wilson (17131782), who recorded his native landscape with a classical restraint. Turner even travelled to the earlier artists birthplace at Penegoes in Montgomeryshire. This work was painted at that time, but not exhibited. It may have been developed as an exercise in the manner of Wilson.

For an oil sketch for this picture, probably sent by Turner to Sir John Leicester to gain his approval of the viewpoint, see No. 208 [D06848].Finberg states that the picture fetched more at the de Tabley sale (165 guineas) than Sir John Leicester had paid for it, which seems to contradict Farington's report that Callcott had told him that the Tabley views were of Turner's 250 guineas size. It seems probable, however, that Turner charged a reduced price, perhaps 300 guineas for the pair, as it was his custom to charge less for pictures painted on commission (see note to companion picture about Turner's prices and also entry for No. 403).It seems likely that Turner and Lord Egremont met at the de Tabley sale as they both bought pictures there, and that this led to a renewal of their friendship which seems to have lapsed since 1814 (see the entry for No. 128 for a possible explanation). At any rate, Turner was invited to stay at Petworth the following month, August 1827, a visit which probably led to the commission to paint the four pictures for the dining room (Nos. 28891 [T03883-T03886]).Sir Francis Bourgeois, the artist, told Farington that Turner's views of Tabley were gaudy but not brilliant. At the R.A. this picture received a separate notice in theMorning Heraldfor 4 May: In this felicitous imitation of a calm morning, the Artist has evidently taken Cuyp for his study; and it is but just to aver, that he has preserved the aerialperspectivebetter than any other Artist within our remembrance, at least in this country. There is suchreposein the wholecomposition, each part harmonizes with its adjunct object so happily, that a troubled spirit might dwell upon this picture in contemplation, until the nervous system were re-attuned by quietude, receiving an imperceptible anodyne through the operations of sympathy.Besides reminiscences of Cuyp (which make this picture a precursor of theDort, No. 137) the pale tonality also perhaps reflects the influence of Turner's friend and follower Callcott, a number of whose pictures were bought by Sir John Leicester.Reunited at the Turner Bicentenary exhibition, it was easy to see why this superb pair brought Turner further commissions of the same kind from Lord Egremont and Lord Lonsdale in the following year (see Nos. 108 and 113 [T03880], and 111 and 112). In fact Turner was also to receive commissions of a somewhat similar nature much later in his career when he painted the two views of Mr Moffatt's house at Mortlake terrace (Nos. 235 and 239, exhibited in 1826 and 1827) and in the following year, 1828, when he exhibited the two pictures of East Cowes Castle painted for John Nash (Nos. 242 and 243).Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Such myths had frequently been painted by Henry Fuseli, Professor of Painting at the Royal Academy.Emerging from the gloom, a seated woman raises her arm, as if to conjure up the terrifying apparition on the right.  In 1812 Turner published a modified version of the image under the title Rispah.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.298.[N05509]Outline of the Venus Pudica1828THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5509)Canvas, 53 3/8 \u00d7 38 5/8 (135\u00b75 \u00d7 98)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (353, 1 Academy figure, no dimensions given; identified 1946 by chalk number on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 163, 191.The canvas, stretcher and mode of attachment are identical to those of pictures known to have been painted in Rome in 1828. The figure, painted in red in very dilute oil paint or just possibly watercolour on a canvas prepared for oil paint, is of the well-known Antique type of the Venus Pudica; it may derive specifically from the Venus de' Medici, already to be seen in the Tribuna of the Uffizi in Florence, through which Turner had passed on his way to Rome in the late summer of 1828. However, Turner has shown Venus with her left leg bent, whereas in the Antique prototypes this is the weight-bearing leg; he was therefore presumably working from memory.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard.

In style it is close to sketches associated with Turner's visit to Rome in 1828, though it does not belong to either of the main groups of sketches probably done during this visit (see Nos. 30217 and 31827).Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 2608: Cowes Sketches, 1827[N01998-N02001]TURNER revisited the Isle of Wight in late July and August 1827, staying with the architect John Nash at East Cowes Castle. In an undated letter he asked his father to send one or if possible two pieces of unstretchedcanvas, either a piece measuring 6 ft by 4 ft or a whole length, and it was on a 6 ft by 4 ft canvas, cut into two, that he painted these nine sketches. The 1854 Schedule of the Turner Bequest listed, under nos. 203 to 206, 207 to 210, 211 to 214, and 215 to 218, four Roll[s] containing 4 subjects. Despite the fact that one of the Cowes canvases contained five sketches the two rolls were probably among these four. They were rediscovered at the National Gallery in 1905 and divided into separate pieces. One roll contained Nos. 260 [N01995], 262 [N01993], 264 [N02000], 266 [N01996] and 268 [N02001] and the other Nos. 261 [N01994], 263 [N01998], 265 [N01997] and 267 [N01999].No record was made of the placing of the sketches on the two rolls on canvas, but to a certain extent this can be reconstructed. On the first roll the two largest sketches, Nos. 264 [N02000] and 262 [N01993], were one above the other, flanked on the left by Nos. 266 [N01996], 260 [N01995] (both upside down) and 268 [N02001]. On the other Nos. 267 [N01999] and 263 [N01998] were at the top, Nos. 265 [N01997] and 261 [N01994] below; No. 261 [N01994] was definitely to the right of No. 265 [N01997], and No. 267 [N01999] seems to have been above No. 265 [N01997].It has been suggested by Graham Reynolds that at least some of these sketches were painted on the spot, though the practical difficulties, especially when the artist was out at sea, would have been considerable. As Evelyn Joll has suggested, a clue as to where Turner may have done the sketches is given by the sketchBetween Decks(No. 266 [N01996]). This appears to have been painted a board a man-of-war and there seems no reason why Turner could not have painted the sketches of yachts racing from a ship anchored of Cowes Roads. If so, Turner's vantage point would seem to have been on a ship rather further offshore than the guardship that can be seen in Nos. 242, 261 [N01994] and 262 [N01993]. It is interesting that the three sketches forThe Regatta beating to Windwardwould seem to have been painted alternately on each roll, No. 260 [N01995] on the first, No. 261 [N01994] on the second, and No. 262 [N01993] again on the first; this could have been to allow an assistant time to adjust the roll for a new sketch.The Windsor and Cowes sketchbook (CCXXVI) containsdrawingsof boats racing, boats at anchor, views of the coast and figure studies, though none directly related to the oil sketches, which to a certain extent supports the suggestion that they were done on the spot. It also contains a list of the boats with their names, the names of their owners, and their colours, showing just how detailed was Turner's interest in the Regatta (CCXXVI-80verso).The two groups of sketches of the Regatta were used for the pictures commissioned by John Nash and exhibited the following year (see Nos. 242 and 243). The other three, includingBetween Decks, were not used for more finished pictures.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 313; Reynolds 19692, pp. 6772.267.[N01999]Shipping off East Cowes Headland1827THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (1999)Canvas, irregular, approx. 18 1/8 \u00d7 23 3/4 (46 \u00d7 60)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (? one of 20318; see p. 159); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1919.Exh.Venice 1938 (8); Amsterdam, Berne, Paris, Brussels, Liege (28), Venice and Rome (30) 19478; R.A. 19745 (317, repr. in colour p. 54).Lit.Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, p. 39, colour pl. ix; Reynolds 19692, p. 72.One of the four sketches on the second roll of canvas used at Cowes.

The central part of the picture is based on a Gainsborough, now lost but known from anengravingand an old sale catalogue reproduction (Ellis Waterhouse,Gainsborough1958, p. 108 no. 846, as repr. Robert Cluett sale, New York, 26 May 1932, lot 90); the Gainsborough lacks the windmill and the rainbow. It looks therefore as if Turner may have begun this work as a straight copy but developed thecompositionin accord with his own taste: the rainbow in particular would seem to reflect his especial interests. That Turner was interested in Gainsborough's work is shown by his copy of the older artist'setchingof a Wooded Landscape with Church, Cow and Figure in the sketchbook now at Princeton University Art Museum inscribed The Sketch Book\u2014/of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 17794: Small Thames Sketchesc.1807THESE eighteen sketches of various sizes, painted on mahogany veneer, are all from the Turner Bequest. They were included in the 1854 Schedule as Nos. 184 to 200*, 18 fragments various sizes on Veneers\u2014or thinpanels; in the 1856 Schedule no. 200* [N05534], was inadvertently omitted. They were first numbered, laid down on panels, cleaned and exhibited in 1908 and 1910.The identifiable subjects of these sketches are all on the Thames or its tributary the Wey; several of the Guildford and Godalming views were identified in 1970 by Christopher Pinsent, including No. 186 [N02309], formerly thought to show Windsor Castle. The same area, with the exception of Walton Bridges, is covered bydrawingsin the Windsor, Eton sketchbook and the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVII and XCVIII).The small Thames sketches on panel, like these two sketchbooks, were datedc.1807 by Finberg (1909, i, pp. 251, 253, and 1961, p. 137), a date that still seems most probable. However, in 1969 Gage divided the sketches into three groups and dated them all later. His first group, Nos. 17980 [N02308,N02306], 183 [N02305], 18792 and 194 [N02311], he associates with the Wey, Guildford sketchbook but datesc.180910. His second group, Nos. 184 [N02680] and 185 [N02681], he datesc.181112. His third group comprises Nos. 177 [N02312], 178 [N02678], 181 [N02313], 182 [N02679] and 186 [N02309] and is dated by him toc.1813 or even later, on account of a supposed similarity to the foliage ofCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]), and a greater accomplishment than the small oil sketches onpaperof Devonshire subjects done in 1813 (Nos. 21325). The Devonshire sketches, however, are not strictly comparable in either technique or general approach, and again it seems more likely that, as is argued in the case of the large Thames sketches oncanvas(Nos. 160176), the whole group represents a single campaign playing a crucial part in the rapid development of Turner's approach to nature in the exhibited pictures of 1807 and 1808. Indeed, in 1983 (exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789 no. 20), Gage dated No. 186 toc.1807 and conceded that Turner seemed to have ceasedpaintingthe small Thames sketches on mahogany veneer by about 1811.These sketches were probably done out-of-doors, perhaps from a small boat as the younger Trimmer described, even though he talks of Turner using a large canvas (see p. 116). In them Turner approaches nearest to what Constable termed a natural painter, but, unlike Constable, Turner always seems to have been interested in making a complete pictorialcompositioneven when he came closest to recording a direct experience of nature.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 368; Clark 1949, pp. 989; Finberg 1961, pp. 1367; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, p. 77; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 234; Gage 1965, p. 75 n. 2; Gage 1969, p. 38; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 1619, 228; Wilton 1979, pp. 11118; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789.183.[N02305]The Thames near Windsorc.1807THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2305)Mahogany veneer, 7 3/8 \u00d7 10 5/16 (18\u00b75 \u00d7 26)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (one of 184200*); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1910.Exh.Lisbon and Madrid 1949 (48); Hamburg, Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen 194950 (95); Arts Council tour 1952 (5, repr.); Australian tour 1960 (3); Tokyo and Kyoto 197071 (36, repr. in colour).Lit.Davies 1946, p. 189, n. 19; Gage 1969, p. 38.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

It was then mislaid at the National Gallery and not rediscovered until 1968, when it was returned to the Tate Gallery. Sufficient original paint remains for there to be some possibility that the picture can be at least partially restored sometime in the future. At present, however, its surface is protected by mulberrypaper.There is a possible sketch for the picture in the River sketchbook ofc.18234 (CCIV-7verso) and a study among thedrawingsin pen and whitechalkon blue paper done by Turner while staying with John Nash at East Cowes Castle in JulySeptember 1827 (CCXXVII(a)-15). For this reason Finberg suggests that Turner may even have begun thepaintingthere, on the full-length canvas that, in a letter written to his father during his stay, Turner suggested might be sent in addition to the 6 ft by 4 ft canvas used for the Cowes sketches, Nos. 26068 [N01993-N02001].Jerrold Ziff has pointed out that there are also twocompositionsketches among the drawings ininkandpencilon blue paper mainly connected with theFrench Riversseries (CCLX-7 and 8) and has also suggested that the four studies on the back of S. Lovegrove's letter to Turner of 19 November 1827 may be related (CCLXIII(a)-7; for the letter see Gageop. cit., pp. 11213).The Schedule of the Turner Bequest, supported by Thornbury suggests that the picture was painted for Mr Broadhurst, though he never seems to have owned it (see also No. 231). In June 1828 John Pye advertised for subscribers to anengravingof the picture, but this was never produced. It was the subject of a letter from Pye to Turner of 3 June 1828 which was endorsed by his brother, I believe the plate wasetchedby my brother but it was not engraved by him.The picture was hung immediately below Thomas Phillips' full-lengthportraitof the Duke of Sussex at the head of the Great Room at the R.A., then at Somerset House, and was described there by theLiterary Gazettefor 3 May 1828 as a very brilliant and powerfullandscape. A week later, however, on 10 May, theLiterary Gazettewas more critical: Visitor, before you venture to look at this picture pray take a hint from the prettyPeasant of Andernach(No. 78, by H. Howard, R.A.), and veil your sight as she does; or it will be over-powered by the glare of the violent colours here assembled. It is really too much for an artist to exercise so despotic a sway over the sun, as to make that glorious, and, as it has been hitherto supposed, independent luminary, act precisely in conformity to his caprice; pouring its rays on objects upon which they could not possibly fall, and hiding them from others in the direct line of their influence. There is scarcely a word of truth in the whole picture.The general consensus seems to have been that it was extremely beautiful and powerful but is like nothing in nature (The Times,6 May, which also said,aproposthe title, that it might as well be called any thing else). Or, as theAthenaeumfor 7 May put it, it is a remarkable and spirited composition; replete with ideas of beauty, and extremely brilliant, hardy, and powerful; but over-wrought in effect\u2014hors de nature, tout \u00e0 fait.The right-hand corner of the picture is wonderfully rich; and the introduction of the dark-green pine-tree is astonishingly bold. TheRepository of Artsfor June 1828, beginning with the general point that where an artist has gained so much deserved celebrity in his profession as theacademicprofessor ofperspective, the repetition of his merits becomes a trite topic, and likening Turner to those meteor-like spirits of the sun which nourish and illumine our denser and more opaque orbs, went on to praise the richness of colouring of this picture: the brilliant and glowing verdure on the left is in the highest degree fine: but whence comes the ruffling of the water? With such a serene and calm atmosphere, there ought not to be a ripple, even if a tide flowed into the ports of Carthage. The reflected light on the edifices upon the right bank is of an unpleasant buff-colour; perhaps Dido liked it; now we don't, and are glad it is only used as what the painters callprimingin this country. The conception of this picture is, however, grand; its execution full of powers of the highest order; and the subject is one we must admit which gave the artist a great latitude in the management of details.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.Nos. 31827 Small Italian Sketches, 1828?THESE small sketches on millboard are distinct in style from those, also from the Turner Bequest, found at the British Museum (Nos. 485500). Several are painted on muslin stretched over the millboard, but there is evidence that one of the sketches on muslin was originally on the same piece of millboard as one of those painted directly onto the board (see Nos. 324 [N05545] and 325 [N05535]). A number of these sketches seem to show landscapes in the vicinity of Rome and Naples. Though very different from earlier sketches from nature like those done of the Thamesc.1807 (Nos. 16094) they have a directness and freshness which suggests that they may also have been done out-of-doors, though with formal compositions in mind from the outset. There is no secure evidence that Turner went to Naples on his second visit to Rome but it would have been easy for him to do so, and this group of sketches has usually been dated to this visit. Nevertheless, they could have been done on the 1819 visit, when, however, Turner did a far greater amount of work onpaper. Evelyn Joll, in the 19834 Paris exhibition catalogue (p. 111), stresses the factors in favour of an 1819 dating though he does not commit himself to this; see also under Nos. 318 [N05526] and 319 [N05530].321.[N05528]Landscape with Trees and a Castle1828?THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5528)Millboard, 16 5/16 \u00d7 23 5/8 (41\u00b75 \u00d7 60)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (173, one of 5 each 1'11 1/4\" \u00d7 1'4\", see No. 318 [N05526]; identified 1946 by chalk number on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Exh.Dresden (5, repr.) and Berlin (7) 1972; Lisbon 1973 (7, repr.).Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 166, 189; Gage 1969, pp. 39, 96, 232 n. 106.One of the group of sketches of Italian scenes on millboard, probably done in Italy during Turner's second visit of 18289; see p. 179.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

A number of them are also related todrawingsin the Thames from Reading to Walton sketchbook, datablec.1806 (XCV; pp. 223 are sketches for the pictures of Walton Bridges, paid for early in 1807, see Nos. 60 and 63);c.f.for example pp. 31 and 37 with No. 173 [N02699], and p. 35 with No. 172 [N02706]; there is a different view of Goring Church, the subject of No. 161 [N02704], on p. 19. Thecompositionof one example,Trees beside a River, with a Bridge in the Middle Distance(No. 169 [N02692]), is very close to a drawing in the rather earlier Studies for Pictures; Isleworth sketchbook, sandwiched between lists ofclassicaland Biblical subjects (XC-55versoand 56): for the evidence for dating this sketchbookc.18045 see Nos. 149 [T03870] and 169 [N02692].There is reason to suppose that, contrary to Turner's usual practice, some if not all of these sketches were at least begun out-of-doors. Thornbury prints some reminiscences of the son of Turner's oldest friend the Rev. Mr. Trimmer, who had been out fishing with Turner when a child. He had a boat at Richmond ... From his boat he painted on a large canvas direct from Nature. Till you have seen these sketches, you know nothing of Turner's powers. There are about two score of these large subjects, rolled up, and now national property ... There is a red sunset (simply the sky) among the rolls. The last, probably the sadly darkenedSunset(No. 525 [N01876]), is different in character from the works under discussion and is probably later, but the folded and battered condition of many of the Thames sketches such as Nos. 171[N02703] and 173 [N02699] supports the identification with the works mentioned by Trimmer, as does the fact that the sketches seem to have been unstretched when they came to be relined early this century; indeed, some if not all may never have been stretched, No. 167 [N02705] for instance showing none of the usual pulling at the edges from the nails attaching a canvas to a stretcher. As in the case of two later groups of sketches on canvas, those painted in the Isle of Wight in 1827 (Nos. 260268 [N01995-N02001]) and those done in Rome 18289 (Nos. 302317), Turner may have painted on rolls of canvas, working them over a frame to use different areas as required. If these sketches were always on loose canvases they may have been the Roll of 17 separate Canvasses, nos. 219 to 235 in the inventory of the Turner Bequest. All but one were first numbered, restored and put on public exhibition in 1910; No. 165 [N05519], which is in considerably worse condition, was not even numbered until 1944.Though Turner did not complete his own cottage at Twickenham, across the river from Richmond, until 1813, he already had a second home at Isleworth, not that much further from Richmond, by 23 May 1805 (see Youngbloodop. cit., p. 34 n. 9), and at Upper Mall, Hammersmith probably from late 1806 until 1811, and he could well have had a boat at Richmond during all this period. John Gage suggested in 1969 that this group of sketches was executed over a number of years from about 1807 to as late asCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]); however in 1983 he accepted our dating for two of the sketches made on the Thames above London although dating one of the Thames estuary sketches (No. 176,q.v[N02698].) toc.1809. It is difficult to be sure of Turner's methods but the evidence of the sketchbooks and also of the groups of oil sketches that he is known to have painted on rolls of canvas, at Cowes in 1827 (Nos. 2608 [N01995-N02001]) and in and around Rome in 1828 (Nos. 30217) suggest that he was more likely to execute a whole run of sketches, varying in execution and degree of finish to a considerable extent, in a short time than to spread such series over periods of years. It seems likely therefore that Turner only used this rather unusual size and technique for this sort of sketch as a limited experiment.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 169; 1877, pp. 12021; MacColl 1920, pp. 3840; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, pp. 778; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 246; Gage 1969, pp. 378; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 229; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood, 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 779.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 17794: Small Thames Sketchesc.1807THESE eighteen sketches of various sizes, painted on mahogany veneer, are all from the Turner Bequest. They were included in the 1854 Schedule as Nos. 184 to 200*, 18 fragments various sizes on Veneers\u2014or thinpanels; in the 1856 Schedule no. 200* [N05534], was inadvertently omitted. They were first numbered, laid down on panels, cleaned and exhibited in 1908 and 1910.The identifiable subjects of these sketches are all on the Thames or its tributary the Wey; several of the Guildford and Godalming views were identified in 1970 by Christopher Pinsent, including No. 186 [N02309], formerly thought to show Windsor Castle. The same area, with the exception of Walton Bridges, is covered bydrawingsin the Windsor, Eton sketchbook and the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVII and XCVIII).The small Thames sketches on panel, like these two sketchbooks, were datedc.1807 by Finberg (1909, i, pp. 251, 253, and 1961, p. 137), a date that still seems most probable. However, in 1969 Gage divided the sketches into three groups and dated them all later. His first group, Nos. 17980 [N02308,N02306], 183 [N02305], 18792 and 194 [N02311], he associates with the Wey, Guildford sketchbook but datesc.180910. His second group, Nos. 184 [N02680] and 185 [N02681], he datesc.181112. His third group comprises Nos. 177 [N02312], 178 [N02678], 181 [N02313], 182 [N02679] and 186 [N02309] and is dated by him toc.1813 or even later, on account of a supposed similarity to the foliage ofCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]), and a greater accomplishment than the small oil sketches onpaperof Devonshire subjects done in 1813 (Nos. 21325). The Devonshire sketches, however, are not strictly comparable in either technique or general approach, and again it seems more likely that, as is argued in the case of the large Thames sketches oncanvas(Nos. 160176), the whole group represents a single campaign playing a crucial part in the rapid development of Turner's approach to nature in the exhibited pictures of 1807 and 1808. Indeed, in 1983 (exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789 no. 20), Gage dated No. 186 toc.1807 and conceded that Turner seemed to have ceasedpaintingthe small Thames sketches on mahogany veneer by about 1811.These sketches were probably done out-of-doors, perhaps from a small boat as the younger Trimmer described, even though he talks of Turner using a large canvas (see p. 116). In them Turner approaches nearest to what Constable termed a natural painter, but, unlike Constable, Turner always seems to have been interested in making a complete pictorialcompositioneven when he came closest to recording a direct experience of nature.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 368; Clark 1949, pp. 989; Finberg 1961, pp. 1367; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, p. 77; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 234; Gage 1965, p. 75 n. 2; Gage 1969, p. 38; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 1619, 228; Wilton 1979, pp. 11118; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789.191.[N02302]Newark Abbeyc.1807THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2302)Mahogany veneer, 11 5/8 \u00d7 13 7/8 (29\u00b75 \u00d7 35)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (one of 184200*); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1910.Exh.Tate Gallery 1931 (71); Australian tour 1960 (2); Tokyo and Kyoto 197071 (34, repr.); Dresden (not in catalogue, repr.) and Berlin (3) 1972.Lit.Davies 1946, p. 189 n. 19; Gage 1969, p. 38.See also Nos. 65, 192 [N02677] and 201.

The late twelfth-century east wall of the chancel is framed by an arch just as in theengravingby J. Sands after T. Allom and can still be recognised today, though the extension to the left and the classical urn, added by Turner after he had already completed thelandscapebackground, may be his own invention.Turner visited Tynemouth in 1797 (see the North of England sketchbook, XXXIV-35, repr. in colour Wilkinson 1972, p. 45, and the more finishedwater-colourXXXIII-T) and later included Tynemouth in thePicturesqueViews in England and Wales182738, but no sketch related to thispaintingis known. Nor can the date of this very liquidly painted, almost (and unusually for Turner) Rubensian sketch be more than guessed at: the urn, delicate trees and general lack of weight recall such exhibited oils of the 1820s asWhat You Will!(R. A. 1822, No. 229) andView from the Terrace of a Villa at Niton(R.A. 1826; No. 234), but the picture might also be as early as the small Thames sketches on mahogany veneer of c. 1807, Nos. 17794.

Sir Thomas Lawrence must have been among the early visitors, as Finbergprintsa letter that he wrote on 26 April to a Mr Penrice of Yarmouth, a collector who had consulted him about buying old masters:Dear Sir,While you are meditating on the purchase of pictures of the Old Masters, what say you to setting an example to your rich friends of patronage to living artists? I have just been at the gallery of Mr. Turner (indisputably the firstlandscapepainter in Europe) and there seen a most beautiful picture which in my opinion would be very cheaply purchased at two hundred guineas\u2014the price at which I understand it may be bought. The subject is A scene near Windsor, with young Etonians introduced ... If the expression can apply to landscape it is full of sentiment, and certainly of genius. If you dare hazard the experiment you must do it quickly and authorize me to secure it for you. It would give me very great pleasure, from my respect for the powers of the artist, my admiration of the work, and (may I say it on so slight an acquaintance?) my esteem for you.The size of the picture is (by guess) about three feet in length and a little less in height. It is in his own peculiar manner, butthatat its best; no Flemish finishing, but having in it fine principles of art, the essentials of beauty, and (as far as the subject admits it) even of grandeur.I remain, Dear Sir, etcTHO. LAWRENCEDespite this very warm recommendation, Mr Penrice did not buy the picture. Perhaps, as Lawrence's letter seems to imply, he was more attracted to pictures which showed Flemish finishing and would have preferred Wilkie to Turner. Whether Lord Egremont bought the picture during the exhibition or later is not known but the former seems very possible. He had bought four pictures from the previous year's exhibition and the subject was one which obviously attracted him as he was finally to own three views by Turner of Windsor Castle and its surroundings (Nos. 64 [T03871] and 149 besides this picture), as well asThe Thames at Eton(No. 71 [T03873]).Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.Nos. 31827 Small Italian Sketches, 1828?THESE small sketches on millboard are distinct in style from those, also from the Turner Bequest, found at the British Museum (Nos. 485500). Several are painted on muslin stretched over the millboard, but there is evidence that one of the sketches on muslin was originally on the same piece of millboard as one of those painted directly onto the board (see Nos. 324 [N05545] and 325 [N05535]). A number of these sketches seem to show landscapes in the vicinity of Rome and Naples. Though very different from earlier sketches from nature like those done of the Thamesc.1807 (Nos. 16094) they have a directness and freshness which suggests that they may also have been done out-of-doors, though with formal compositions in mind from the outset. There is no secure evidence that Turner went to Naples on his second visit to Rome but it would have been easy for him to do so, and this group of sketches has usually been dated to this visit. Nevertheless, they could have been done on the 1819 visit, when, however, Turner did a far greater amount of work onpaper. Evelyn Joll, in the 19834 Paris exhibition catalogue (p. 111), stresses the factors in favour of an 1819 dating though he does not commit himself to this; see also under Nos. 318 [N05526] and 319 [N05530].322.[N05531]Mountainous Landscape1828?THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5531)Muslin mounted on millboard, 16 1/4 \u00d7 23 1/2 (41 \u00d7 59\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (174, one of 5 each 1'11 1/4\" \u00d7 1'4\", see No. 318; identified by chalk number on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 166, 189.One of the group of probably Italian scenes painted on muslin mounted on millboard, here tentatively dated to Turner's second Italian visit of 18289; see p. 179.

Turner's renewed interest in figure subjects on this scale as a result of his second visit to Italy in 18289 seems to have resulted in works of a rather richertexture, whether thinly painted like theReclining Venus(No. 296 [N05498]) or more heavily worked up likeTwo Women and a Letter(No. 448 [N05501]).Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

The nine others are similar in style, technique and type of canvas but are not recorded as having been originally joined. However, this second group of sketches shares with the first the peculiarity of having been tacked to some sort of stretcher or support from the front, Turner having gone over the tacks with paint in the process of painting each composition. This suggests that in both cases a large piece of canvas was remounted on a relatively small support each time Turner wanted to paint a new sketch. Both groups are marked by a vertical craquelure, the result of rolling. The 1856 Schedule of the Turner Bequest lists under nos. 20318 four Roll[s] containing 4 subjects, only two of which are accounted for by the Cowes sketches, one of which in fact contained five compositions (see p. 159); the other two rolls could have been that bearing Nos. 3028 together with one containing the other Roman sketches.Those subjects that can be identified are Italian and the first sketch was used for the large picture ofUlysses and Polyphemusexhibited at the R.A. in 1829 (No. 330 [N00508]). It therefore seems likely that they were done in Italy during Turner's second visit in 18289, the use of large rolls of canvas being presumably for ease of transport as seems to have been the case with the Cowes sketches. However, the canvas is not identical with that of the pictures that were exhibited by Turner in Rome (see Nos. 2924 [N00511,N00513,N00519]), nor did those pictures reach London, having been sent by sea, until after the opening of the 1829 R.A. Exhibition, but Turner would not have needed thePolyphemussketch directly in front of him to paint the large picture. Alternatively, whereas Nos. 2924 [N00511,N00513,N00519], and also Nos. 2969 [N05498, N005517,N05509,N05510] and 301 [N05473], seem to have been stretched in Rome and were probably all sent back by sea, Turner could have taken the rolled canvases back with him by land.Unlike the Cowes sketches, which seem to have been the direct result of specific experiences even if not actually painted on the spot, these works are essays in composition; even those based on actual landscapes are of places already known to Turner from his travels in Italy in 1819 if not from pictures by other artists: both Lake Nemi and Tivoli (for which see Nos. 44 [N05512] and 545 [N05538]) had been painted by Wilson. They are studies in broad areas of strongly contrastedtonesof flatly applied colour, occasionally enlivened, as in the case ofLake Nemi, by a flurry of heavyimpasto. The subjects range from recognisable Italian landscapes, through thePolyphemussketch which uses landscape motives based on what Turner could have seen in Italy, to Claudian seaports which depend entirely on the work of another artist. Differing in size one from the other, and not adhering to any of the standard sizes normally used by Turner, these works are definitely sketches rather than unfinished paintings which could have been carried further.Lit.MacColl 1920, p. 42; Davies 1946, p. 189; Kitson 1983, p. 13.306.[N02991]Overlooking the Coast, with Classical Building 1828THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2991)Canvas, irregular, approx. 23 1/2 \u00d7 33 5/8 (60\u00b75 \u00d7 84\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (? one of 20318; see p. 176); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1919.Less resolved than the other sketches in the group, in this case justifying the term unfinished. The composition, with its relatively large, classical portico on the right helping to frame a panoramic view over a distant landscape, is unusual for Turner.There are tack holes along the top and bottom edges.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 17794: Small Thames Sketchesc.1807THESE eighteen sketches of various sizes, painted on mahogany veneer, are all from the Turner Bequest. They were included in the 1854 Schedule as Nos. 184 to 200*, 18 fragments various sizes on Veneers\u2014or thinpanels; in the 1856 Schedule no. 200* [N05534], was inadvertently omitted. They were first numbered, laid down on panels, cleaned and exhibited in 1908 and 1910.The identifiable subjects of these sketches are all on the Thames or its tributary the Wey; several of the Guildford and Godalming views were identified in 1970 by Christopher Pinsent, including No. 186 [N02309], formerly thought to show Windsor Castle. The same area, with the exception of Walton Bridges, is covered bydrawingsin the Windsor, Eton sketchbook and the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVII and XCVIII).The small Thames sketches on panel, like these two sketchbooks, were datedc.1807 by Finberg (1909, i, pp. 251, 253, and 1961, p. 137), a date that still seems most probable. However, in 1969 Gage divided the sketches into three groups and dated them all later. His first group, Nos. 17980 [N02308,N02306], 183 [N02305], 18792 and 194 [N02311], he associates with the Wey, Guildford sketchbook but datesc.180910. His second group, Nos. 184 [N02680] and 185 [N02681], he datesc.181112. His third group comprises Nos. 177 [N02312], 178 [N02678], 181 [N02313], 182 [N02679] and 186 [N02309] and is dated by him toc.1813 or even later, on account of a supposed similarity to the foliage ofCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]), and a greater accomplishment than the small oil sketches onpaperof Devonshire subjects done in 1813 (Nos. 21325). The Devonshire sketches, however, are not strictly comparable in either technique or general approach, and again it seems more likely that, as is argued in the case of the large Thames sketches oncanvas(Nos. 160176), the whole group represents a single campaign playing a crucial part in the rapid development of Turner's approach to nature in the exhibited pictures of 1807 and 1808. Indeed, in 1983 (exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789 no. 20), Gage dated No. 186 toc.1807 and conceded that Turner seemed to have ceasedpaintingthe small Thames sketches on mahogany veneer by about 1811.These sketches were probably done out-of-doors, perhaps from a small boat as the younger Trimmer described, even though he talks of Turner using a large canvas (see p. 116). In them Turner approaches nearest to what Constable termed a natural painter, but, unlike Constable, Turner always seems to have been interested in making a complete pictorialcompositioneven when he came closest to recording a direct experience of nature.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 368; Clark 1949, pp. 989; Finberg 1961, pp. 1367; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, p. 77; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 234; Gage 1965, p. 75 n. 2; Gage 1969, p. 38; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 1619, 228; Wilton 1979, pp. 11118; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789.180.[N02306]Windsor Castle from the Riverc.1807THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2306)Mahogany veneer, 7 7/8 \u00d7 14 7/16 (20 \u00d7 36\u00b75); an irregular strip along the top, ranging from  1/8 (2) on left to  3/8 (1) on right, is a restorationColl.Turner Bequest 1856 (one of 184200*); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1910.Lit.Davies 1946, p. 189 n. 19; Gage 1969, pp. 378.There is a similar but not identical view in the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVIII-128verso).Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

A number of them are also related todrawingsin the Thames from Reading to Walton sketchbook, datablec.1806 (XCV; pp. 223 are sketches for the pictures of Walton Bridges, paid for early in 1807, see Nos. 60 and 63);c.f.for example pp. 31 and 37 with No. 173 [N02699], and p. 35 with No. 172 [N02706]; there is a different view of Goring Church, the subject of No. 161 [N02704], on p. 19. Thecompositionof one example,Trees beside a River, with a Bridge in the Middle Distance(No. 169 [N02692]), is very close to a drawing in the rather earlier Studies for Pictures; Isleworth sketchbook, sandwiched between lists ofclassicaland Biblical subjects (XC-55versoand 56): for the evidence for dating this sketchbookc.18045 see Nos. 149 [T03870] and 169 [N02692].There is reason to suppose that, contrary to Turner's usual practice, some if not all of these sketches were at least begun out-of-doors. Thornbury prints some reminiscences of the son of Turner's oldest friend the Rev. Mr. Trimmer, who had been out fishing with Turner when a child. He had a boat at Richmond ... From his boat he painted on a large canvas direct from Nature. Till you have seen these sketches, you know nothing of Turner's powers. There are about two score of these large subjects, rolled up, and now national property ... There is a red sunset (simply the sky) among the rolls. The last, probably the sadly darkenedSunset(No. 525 [N01876]), is different in character from the works under discussion and is probably later, but the folded and battered condition of many of the Thames sketches such as Nos. 171[N02703] and 173 [N02699] supports the identification with the works mentioned by Trimmer, as does the fact that the sketches seem to have been unstretched when they came to be relined early this century; indeed, some if not all may never have been stretched, No. 167 [N02705] for instance showing none of the usual pulling at the edges from the nails attaching a canvas to a stretcher. As in the case of two later groups of sketches on canvas, those painted in the Isle of Wight in 1827 (Nos. 260268 [N01995-N02001]) and those done in Rome 18289 (Nos. 302317), Turner may have painted on rolls of canvas, working them over a frame to use different areas as required. If these sketches were always on loose canvases they may have been the Roll of 17 separate Canvasses, nos. 219 to 235 in the inventory of the Turner Bequest. All but one were first numbered, restored and put on public exhibition in 1910; No. 165 [N05519], which is in considerably worse condition, was not even numbered until 1944.Though Turner did not complete his own cottage at Twickenham, across the river from Richmond, until 1813, he already had a second home at Isleworth, not that much further from Richmond, by 23 May 1805 (see Youngbloodop. cit., p. 34 n. 9), and at Upper Mall, Hammersmith probably from late 1806 until 1811, and he could well have had a boat at Richmond during all this period. John Gage suggested in 1969 that this group of sketches was executed over a number of years from about 1807 to as late asCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]); however in 1983 he accepted our dating for two of the sketches made on the Thames above London although dating one of the Thames estuary sketches (No. 176,q.v[N02698].) toc.1809. It is difficult to be sure of Turner's methods but the evidence of the sketchbooks and also of the groups of oil sketches that he is known to have painted on rolls of canvas, at Cowes in 1827 (Nos. 2608 [N01995-N02001]) and in and around Rome in 1828 (Nos. 30217) suggest that he was more likely to execute a whole run of sketches, varying in execution and degree of finish to a considerable extent, in a short time than to spread such series over periods of years. It seems likely therefore that Turner only used this rather unusual size and technique for this sort of sketch as a limited experiment.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 169; 1877, pp. 12021; MacColl 1920, pp. 3840; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, pp. 778; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 246; Gage 1969, pp. 378; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 229; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood, 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 779.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.Nos. 31827 Small Italian Sketches, 1828?THESE small sketches on millboard are distinct in style from those, also from the Turner Bequest, found at the British Museum (Nos. 485500). Several are painted on muslin stretched over the millboard, but there is evidence that one of the sketches on muslin was originally on the same piece of millboard as one of those painted directly onto the board (see Nos. 324 [N05545] and 325 [N05535]). A number of these sketches seem to show landscapes in the vicinity of Rome and Naples. Though very different from earlier sketches from nature like those done of the Thamesc.1807 (Nos. 16094) they have a directness and freshness which suggests that they may also have been done out-of-doors, though with formal compositions in mind from the outset. There is no secure evidence that Turner went to Naples on his second visit to Rome but it would have been easy for him to do so, and this group of sketches has usually been dated to this visit. Nevertheless, they could have been done on the 1819 visit, when, however, Turner did a far greater amount of work onpaper. Evelyn Joll, in the 19834 Paris exhibition catalogue (p. 111), stresses the factors in favour of an 1819 dating though he does not commit himself to this; see also under Nos. 318 [N05526] and 319 [N05530].324.[N05545]Landscape with a Tree on the Right1828?THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5545)Millboard, 11 \u00d7 16 3/8 (28 \u00d7 41\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (part of 180 with No. 325, one of 5 each 1'8 1/2\" \u00d7 1'4 1/2\", see No. 323; identified 1946 by chalk number on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 168, 189 n. 18.Originally on the same sheet of millboard as No. 325 [N05535], though that picture was painted on muslin attached to the board, whereas this example was painted directly onto the board. An inscription on the back reads, 180a one board with 180b, cut by C.H. [(Sir) Charles Holroyd] June 1908. The join was apparently along the top of each composition. This picture is clearly from the group of Italian landscapes such as Nos. 31921 [N05530,N05527,N05528], and like them can be tentatively associated with Turner's second visit to Italy of 18289.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Spoilt by water, it was subsequently used for six roughmonochromesketches in grey paint, most if not all working towards thecompositionofDawn of Christianity (Flight into Egypt), exhibited in 1841 (No. 394). With the canvas used as an upright there is across the top a single landscape, flanked by trees. Below this are three related compositions, circular in composition like the exhibited picture. That on the left has a part-outline, following a circle, in the same grey paint as the sketch itself; the other two seem to have been circumscribed by scratching into the white ground. A further circular sketch, roughly framed in the same grey paint, was painted below but with the canvas the other way up; this contains a pyramidal feature that connects it more closely with the Egyptian setting of the finished oil, though in other respects it is less close in composition than are the sketches already mentioned. Finally, adjacent to this, there are rough indications of foliage, particularly close to the large tree on the left of the finished oil, with another feature further to the left.The original canvas bears a duty stamp incorporating the apparent date of 1828 though the last digit is very difficult to read (see Butlinloc. cit.). This would, of course, support the suggestion that the canvas was originally prepared for one of the Petworth landscapes ofc.18289.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.Nos. 31827 Small Italian Sketches, 1828?THESE small sketches on millboard are distinct in style from those, also from the Turner Bequest, found at the British Museum (Nos. 485500). Several are painted on muslin stretched over the millboard, but there is evidence that one of the sketches on muslin was originally on the same piece of millboard as one of those painted directly onto the board (see Nos. 324 [N05545] and 325 [N05535]). A number of these sketches seem to show landscapes in the vicinity of Rome and Naples. Though very different from earlier sketches from nature like those done of the Thamesc.1807 (Nos. 16094) they have a directness and freshness which suggests that they may also have been done out-of-doors, though with formal compositions in mind from the outset. There is no secure evidence that Turner went to Naples on his second visit to Rome but it would have been easy for him to do so, and this group of sketches has usually been dated to this visit. Nevertheless, they could have been done on the 1819 visit, when, however, Turner did a far greater amount of work onpaper. Evelyn Joll, in the 19834 Paris exhibition catalogue (p. 111), stresses the factors in favour of an 1819 dating though he does not commit himself to this; see also under Nos. 318 [N05526] and 319 [N05530].320.[N05527]Coast Scene near Naples1828?THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5527)Millboard, 16 1/8 \u00d7 23 1/2 (41 \u00d7 59\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (175, one of 5 each 1'11 1/4\" \u00d7 1'4\"; see No. 318 [N05526]; identified 1946 bychalknumber on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Exh.New York 1966 (4, repr. p. 11); R.A. 19745 (470); Leningrad and Moscow 19756 (51); Paris 19834 (48, repr.).Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 165, 189; Gage 1969, pp. 39, 96, 232 n. 106; Herrmann 1975, p. 35, pl. 125.One of the group of sketches discussed on p. 179.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 2608: Cowes Sketches, 1827[N01998-N02001]TURNER revisited the Isle of Wight in late July and August 1827, staying with the architect John Nash at East Cowes Castle. In an undated letter he asked his father to send one or if possible two pieces of unstretchedcanvas, either a piece measuring 6 ft by 4 ft or a whole length, and it was on a 6 ft by 4 ft canvas, cut into two, that he painted these nine sketches. The 1854 Schedule of the Turner Bequest listed, under nos. 203 to 206, 207 to 210, 211 to 214, and 215 to 218, four Roll[s] containing 4 subjects. Despite the fact that one of the Cowes canvases contained five sketches the two rolls were probably among these four. They were rediscovered at the National Gallery in 1905 and divided into separate pieces. One roll contained Nos. 260 [N01995], 262 [N01993], 264 [N02000], 266 [N01996] and 268 [N02001] and the other Nos. 261 [N01994], 263 [N01998], 265 [N01997] and 267 [N01999].No record was made of the placing of the sketches on the two rolls on canvas, but to a certain extent this can be reconstructed. On the first roll the two largest sketches, Nos. 264 [N02000] and 262 [N01993], were one above the other, flanked on the left by Nos. 266 [N01996], 260 [N01995] (both upside down) and 268 [N02001]. On the other Nos. 267 [N01999] and 263 [N01998] were at the top, Nos. 265 [N01997] and 261 [N01994] below; No. 261 [N01994] was definitely to the right of No. 265 [N01997], and No. 267 [N01999] seems to have been above No. 265 [N01997].It has been suggested by Graham Reynolds that at least some of these sketches were painted on the spot, though the practical difficulties, especially when the artist was out at sea, would have been considerable. As Evelyn Joll has suggested, a clue as to where Turner may have done the sketches is given by the sketchBetween Decks(No. 266 [N01996]). This appears to have been painted a board a man-of-war and there seems no reason why Turner could not have painted the sketches of yachts racing from a ship anchored of Cowes Roads. If so, Turner's vantage point would seem to have been on a ship rather further offshore than the guardship that can be seen in Nos. 242, 261 [N01994] and 262 [N01993]. It is interesting that the three sketches forThe Regatta beating to Windwardwould seem to have been painted alternately on each roll, No. 260 [N01995] on the first, No. 261 [N01994] on the second, and No. 262 [N01993] again on the first; this could have been to allow an assistant time to adjust the roll for a new sketch.The Windsor and Cowes sketchbook (CCXXVI) containsdrawingsof boats racing, boats at anchor, views of the coast and figure studies, though none directly related to the oil sketches, which to a certain extent supports the suggestion that they were done on the spot. It also contains a list of the boats with their names, the names of their owners, and their colours, showing just how detailed was Turner's interest in the Regatta (CCXXVI-80verso).The two groups of sketches of the Regatta were used for the pictures commissioned by John Nash and exhibited the following year (see Nos. 242 and 243). The other three, includingBetween Decks, were not used for more finished pictures.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 313; Reynolds 19692, pp. 6772.266.[N01996]Between Decks1827THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (1996)Canvas, 12 \u00d7 19 1/8 (30\u00b75 \u00d7 48\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (? one of 20318; see p. 159); transferred to the Tate Gallery. 1906.Exh.British Narrative PaintingsC.E.M.A. tour 1944 (35); R.A. 19745 (318); Paris 19834 (40, repr.).Lit.Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, p. 39; Reynolds 19692, p. 72, pl. 5; Herrmann 1975, p. 33, pl. 121.One of the five sketches from the first roll of canvas used at Cowes in 1827. This may be a scene of visitors on board the naval guardship seen in the background of Nos. 26162 [N01993-N01992]; it could alternatively reflect the practice, up to about 1805 and perhaps later, of accommodating sailors' wives between the upper and lower decks when a ship was in port. For a suggestion that the ship was rather further offshore than the guardship, and was the base from which Turner painted his sketches of yachts racing, see p. 159.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Working from his boat, he painted two sets of oil sketches, a series on mahogany that are evidently private works, and a group of larger studies on unstretched sheets ofcanvasprepared with an off-white ground; the canvas was carried rolled, and tacked over a frame or board while he painted. Turner's pictorial vision is evident in all these sketches, but those on canvas were painted to a standard exhibition size and thoroughly resolved compositionally, suggesting that Turner was experimenting with beginning pictures outdoors.Gallery label, August 2004Does this text contain inaccurate information or language that you feel we should improve or change?We would like to hear from you.Read more",

A number of drawings connected with this picture are in the Studies for Pictures; Isleworth sketchbook (XC pp. 6, 9, 29 and 31; that on p. 29 includes a reclining figure, an idea Turner evidently later abandoned in favour of the peacock; the drawing on p. 8versomay also be connected). In his 1909InventoryFinberg originally dated this sketchbook 18056 but later corrected this to 181112 in hisLife of J.M.W. Turner. While the presence of sketches forMercury and Herse(No. 114) exhibited in 1811, suggests support for Finberg's second thoughts, it is now clear that the book was in use c. 18045; there is also awatercolourstudy forWindsor Castle from the Thames(see No. 149 [T03870]) which can be fairly certainly dated on stylistic grounds toc.1805. No details of which pictures were shown at Turner's gallery in 1813 have survived so that Finberg's suggestion that this picture was included remains pure guesswork, based largely on his dating of the sketchbook already mentioned and his assumption that Turner was living at Isleworth 181113. Now, however, that we know (see entry for No. 149 [T03870]) that he was at this address in 1805, the brackets for dating this picture become much wider. On stylistic grounds affinities with other river scenes such asOn the Brent(No. 198) andPope's Villa at Twickenham(No. 72) support a dating of 180710. For instance, thepaintingof the flowers and foliage in the foreground in all three pictures is particularly close. As we know to a great extent the pictures shown in Turner's gallery in 1808 and all those shown in 1809 and 1810, this may even have been shown as early as 1807 and be amongst the views on the Thames which disgusted Benjamin West so much on his visit to the exhibition in that year.It appears to be uncertain when this picture first received its present title but it is listed as such both by Waagen and in the 1856 Petworth Inventory. Edward Croft-Murray suggested that it may be a view along the river from Isleworth, with the battlemented corner of Syon House visible between the trees at the left. This seems a more likely possibility than the traditional identification but the view may be to some extent a capriccio.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Lowson, who acted as Turners paymaster for the tour, largely determined his itinerary. From Grenoble, they travelled to Geneva, Chamonix and Aosta, and crossed the Great St Bernard Pass to the Swiss town of Martigny, halfway into the tour. Once thought to be Wales, this view is now believed to be of Martigny, featuring the thirteenth century Ch\u00e2teau de la B\u00e2tiaz, depicted in several of Turners pencil drawings.Gallery label, February 2010Does this text contain inaccurate information or language that you feel we should improve or change?We would like to hear from you.Read more",

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 17794: Small Thames Sketchesc.1807THESE eighteen sketches of various sizes, painted on mahogany veneer, are all from the Turner Bequest. They were included in the 1854 Schedule as Nos. 184 to 200*, 18 fragments various sizes on Veneers\u2014or thinpanels; in the 1856 Schedule no. 200* [N05534], was inadvertently omitted. They were first numbered, laid down on panels, cleaned and exhibited in 1908 and 1910.The identifiable subjects of these sketches are all on the Thames or its tributary the Wey; several of the Guildford and Godalming views were identified in 1970 by Christopher Pinsent, including No. 186 [N02309], formerly thought to show Windsor Castle. The same area, with the exception of Walton Bridges, is covered bydrawingsin the Windsor, Eton sketchbook and the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVII and XCVIII).The small Thames sketches on panel, like these two sketchbooks, were datedc.1807 by Finberg (1909, i, pp. 251, 253, and 1961, p. 137), a date that still seems most probable. However, in 1969 Gage divided the sketches into three groups and dated them all later. His first group, Nos. 17980 [N02308,N02306], 183 [N02305], 18792 and 194 [N02311], he associates with the Wey, Guildford sketchbook but datesc.180910. His second group, Nos. 184 [N02680] and 185 [N02681], he datesc.181112. His third group comprises Nos. 177 [N02312], 178 [N02678], 181 [N02313], 182 [N02679] and 186 [N02309] and is dated by him toc.1813 or even later, on account of a supposed similarity to the foliage ofCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]), and a greater accomplishment than the small oil sketches onpaperof Devonshire subjects done in 1813 (Nos. 21325). The Devonshire sketches, however, are not strictly comparable in either technique or general approach, and again it seems more likely that, as is argued in the case of the large Thames sketches oncanvas(Nos. 160176), the whole group represents a single campaign playing a crucial part in the rapid development of Turner's approach to nature in the exhibited pictures of 1807 and 1808. Indeed, in 1983 (exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789 no. 20), Gage dated No. 186 toc.1807 and conceded that Turner seemed to have ceasedpaintingthe small Thames sketches on mahogany veneer by about 1811.These sketches were probably done out-of-doors, perhaps from a small boat as the younger Trimmer described, even though he talks of Turner using a large canvas (see p. 116). In them Turner approaches nearest to what Constable termed a natural painter, but, unlike Constable, Turner always seems to have been interested in making a complete pictorialcompositioneven when he came closest to recording a direct experience of nature.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 368; Clark 1949, pp. 989; Finberg 1961, pp. 1367; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, p. 77; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 234; Gage 1965, p. 75 n. 2; Gage 1969, p. 38; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 1619, 228; Wilton 1979, pp. 11118; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789.181.[N02313]Eton from the Riverc.1807THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2313)Mahogany veneer, 14 1/4 \u00d7 26 1/8 (37 \u00d7 66\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (one of 184200*); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1919.Exh.Tate Gallery 1931 (70); Amsterdam, Berne, Paris, Brussels, Liege (6), Venice and Rome (7), 19478; Paris 1953 (68, pl. 34); Cologne (55, repr.), Rome (56, repr.) and Warsaw (56, repr.) 19667;The Thames in ArtHenley and Cheltenham JuneJuly 1967 (19);Paintings of the Thames ValleyReading Museum and Art Gallery FebruaryMarch 1968 (24); R.A. 19745 (140).Lit.Davies 1946, p. 189 n. 19; Herrmann 1963, p. 12, pl. 4; Gage 1969, p. 38.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Thornbury prints some reminiscences of the son of Turner's oldest friend the Rev. Mr. Trimmer, who had been out fishing with Turner when a child. He had a boat at Richmond ... From his boat he painted on a large canvas direct from Nature. Till you have seen these sketches, you know nothing of Turner's powers. There are about two score of these large subjects, rolled up, and now national property ... There is a red sunset (simply the sky) among the rolls. The last, probably the sadly darkenedSunset(No. 525 [N01876]), is different in character from the works under discussion and is probably later, but the folded and battered condition of many of the Thames sketches such as Nos. 171[N02703] and 173 [N02699] supports the identification with the works mentioned by Trimmer, as does the fact that the sketches seem to have been unstretched when they came to be relined early this century; indeed, some if not all may never have been stretched, No. 167 [N02705] for instance showing none of the usual pulling at the edges from the nails attaching a canvas to a stretcher. As in the case of two later groups of sketches on canvas, those painted in the Isle of Wight in 1827 (Nos. 260268 [N01995-N02001]) and those done in Rome 18289 (Nos. 302317), Turner may have painted on rolls of canvas, working them over a frame to use different areas as required. If these sketches were always on loose canvases they may have been the Roll of 17 separate Canvasses, nos. 219 to 235 in the inventory of the Turner Bequest. All but one were first numbered, restored and put on public exhibition in 1910; No. 165 [N05519], which is in considerably worse condition, was not even numbered until 1944.Though Turner did not complete his own cottage at Twickenham, across the river from Richmond, until 1813, he already had a second home at Isleworth, not that much further from Richmond, by 23 May 1805 (see Youngbloodop. cit., p. 34 n. 9), and at Upper Mall, Hammersmith probably from late 1806 until 1811, and he could well have had a boat at Richmond during all this period. John Gage suggested in 1969 that this group of sketches was executed over a number of years from about 1807 to as late asCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]); however in 1983 he accepted our dating for two of the sketches made on the Thames above London although dating one of the Thames estuary sketches (No. 176,q.v[N02698].) toc.1809. It is difficult to be sure of Turner's methods but the evidence of the sketchbooks and also of the groups of oil sketches that he is known to have painted on rolls of canvas, at Cowes in 1827 (Nos. 2608 [N01995-N02001]) and in and around Rome in 1828 (Nos. 30217) suggest that he was more likely to execute a whole run of sketches, varying in execution and degree of finish to a considerable extent, in a short time than to spread such series over periods of years. It seems likely therefore that Turner only used this rather unusual size and technique for this sort of sketch as a limited experiment.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.299.[N05510]Southern Landscape1828THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5510)Canvas, 69 1/2 \u00d7 99 1/8 (176\u00b75 \u00d7 252)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (246, 1 unidentified 8'2 1/4\" \u00d7 5'10\"; identified 1946 by chalk number on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 163, 190.Canvas, stretcher and mode of attachment are the same as inMedea, No. 293 [N00513], and the picture must therefore have been painted in Rome during Turner's second Italian visit of 18289.The picture is badly spotted with mould.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 2478b : George IV's Visit to Edinburgh, 1822[N02857-N02858;N02879-N02880]IN August 1822, the year after his coronation, George IV paid a two-week state visit to Edinburgh, the first by a British monarch since the Act of Union of 1707. The Royal Squadron arrived at Leith on 14 August and George IV landed the following day, staying at the Palace of Holyrood until 29 August. The visit was staged by Sir Walter Scott. A number of artists attended the occasion, including Turner, who seems to have been in Edinburgh as early as 7 August (he was definitely there by 14 August) and was presumably there until the end of the royal visit.Gerald Finley has suggested that Turner planned a series ofpaintingscovering this visit, to beengravedand probably in the hope of royal patronage.Turner used two sketchbooks in Edinburgh, the King's Visit to Scotland sketchbook (CC) and the King at Edinburgh sketchbook (CCI), the latter containing a double-spread of nineteen roughcompositionsketches (p. 44versoand inside back cover; both sketchbooks are repr. in full in Finley 1981); four of these can be linked with paintings in the Turner Bequest, two long identified with this visit (Nos. 247 [N02857] and 248 [N02858]), the other two only recently identified by Finley, a discovery reflected in the exhibition and accompanying book ofTurner and George the Fourth in Edinburgh, 1822, 19812.All four paintings are onpanel, relatively unusual for Turner, two being approximately 2 1/2 inches higher than the others. It is uncertain how many pictures Turner would have completed had the scheme been fulfilled. It is also uncertain why the scheme was abandoned but the reason is hinted at in a letter of 3 December 1823 to J.C. Schetky. From this it appears that Schetky had offered Turner the use of one of hisdrawingsof the Royal Barge, only roughly sketched by Turner during his visit, but, so Turner writes, there is an end to that commission owing to the difficulty attending engraving the subjects (Gageloc. cit.). Turner had presumably abandoned work on the paintings by this time.Lit.Finley 1975, pp. 2735; Gage 1980, p. 90; Finley 1981.248a.[N02879]Sir Walter Scott going out to meet George IVc.1822THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2879)Mahogany, 26 3/4 \u00d7 36 1/8 (68 \u00d7 91\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (152, one of 3 each (ditto [panel]) 3'0\" \u00d7 2'3\"; identified by chalk number on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1919.Exh.Tate Gallery and Edinburgh 19812.Lit.Finley 1981, pp. 32, 3843, pl. 14.The subject has been identified by Gerald Finley.

    "description": "Display captionThis was painted on a very thick, high-quality artists hardwood panel which (unusually) lacks a suppliers label on the reverse. Turner used the panel as a sketching board, and could have accidentally soaked off any label as he worked. He glued down heavy paper along all four edges, painted on the restrained paper (which could be soaked with water, brushed and scratched vigorously, and left to dry before repeating these processes, or even dried near a fire indoors), and later loosened it with a knife, then tore it off roughly.The board was used several times. When it was upright, the paper was a half-sheet of the larger sheet that had previously almost filled the board. Traces of watercolour paint in many colours, blobs of animal glue, and knife and tear marks in the remaining paper, form the evidence for this alternative use. No other Turner sketching board has survived.Paint surfaces:The panel may have been supplied with the slightly offwhite priming visible in many places. Initial thinned washes of coloured oil paint were strengthened with less-thinned paint applied with a broad, stiff brush that left its mark on the surface. More brush-strokes in the foreground than the background economically and rapidly created a sense of distance.Clouds were applied over the bare priming with a broad, soft-haired brush and white paint: their warm yellowness is an effect of the paint medium. This was probably megilp, a gel-like material made from leaded linseed oil and mastic resin varnish, which could form both soft impasto and thin but continuous glossy paint films, and which was always yellow in tone. In thicker applications, the yellowness and the cracks that readily form as megilp dries can be obvious. Here it was used thinly, and over paint less rich in medium. This is the classically correct way to create durable paint surfaces  though Turner frequently broke this rule and thereby promoted cracking and paint loss.Gallery label, February 2010Does this text contain inaccurate information or language that you feel we should improve or change?We would like to hear from you.Read more",

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.Nos. 31827 Small Italian Sketches, 1828?THESE small sketches on millboard are distinct in style from those, also from the Turner Bequest, found at the British Museum (Nos. 485500). Several are painted on muslin stretched over the millboard, but there is evidence that one of the sketches on muslin was originally on the same piece of millboard as one of those painted directly onto the board (see Nos. 324 [N05545] and 325 [N05535]). A number of these sketches seem to show landscapes in the vicinity of Rome and Naples. Though very different from earlier sketches from nature like those done of the Thamesc.1807 (Nos. 16094) they have a directness and freshness which suggests that they may also have been done out-of-doors, though with formal compositions in mind from the outset. There is no secure evidence that Turner went to Naples on his second visit to Rome but it would have been easy for him to do so, and this group of sketches has usually been dated to this visit. Nevertheless, they could have been done on the 1819 visit, when, however, Turner did a far greater amount of work onpaper. Evelyn Joll, in the 19834 Paris exhibition catalogue (p. 111), stresses the factors in favour of an 1819 dating though he does not commit himself to this; see also under Nos. 318 [N05526] and 319 [N05530].319.[N05530]Seacoast with Ruin, probably the Bay of Baiae1828?THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5530)Muslin mounted on millboard, 16 1/4 \u00d7 23 11/16 (41 \u00d7 60)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (172, one of 5 each 1'11 1/4\" \u00d7 1'4\", see No. 318; identified 1946 by chalk number on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 166, 189.The octagonal ruin and distant promontory seem to be the same as those that appear on the right-hand side ofThe Bay of Baiae(No. 230 [N00505]), where they can be identified as the Antique Temple of Diana and the sixteenth-century Castello di Baia. The larger painting was exhibited in 1823, which could perhaps suggest that this sketch dates from Turner's first visit to Italy in 1819, but see p. 179 for the reasons for dating this group of sketches to Turner's second visit of 18289.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

The composition is not particularly close to the scene in St Giles (No. 247 [N02857]) but bears some resemblance to one of the tiny composition sketches in the King at Edinburgh sketchbook, that numbered 12 and identified by Gerald Finley as possibly depicting the removal of the Regalia from the Throne Room in Holyrood Palace on 24 August (CCI-44versoand back cover; Finley 1975, p. 32, repr. p. 29 fig. 18). Here, however, the effect is less of an arcaded background than of a Gothic vault.Gerald Finley cannot, however, confirm a connection with the George IV project, and it is probably best at the moment to accept the more general identification of Martin Davies: A scene in a Church (unfinished): A procession, apparently; alternatively, as two static groups of figures appear to be shown, perhaps a baptism or wedding is depicted. As noted in the catalogue of the 1977 Tate Gallery exhibition, after the picture had been cleaned for the first time, one of the figures in the foreground is apparently holding a baby, which suggests that the subject may be a christening. If so, the ceremony must just have ended, as figures in the background can be seen bowing to the Church dignitaries (?) in their vestments, who are going out through the arch.If, as now seems likely, the subject is not specifically related to the Royal visit to Edinburgh of 1822, the picture could be rather later, though it lacks the richness and Rembrandtesquechiaroscuroof the interiors associated with Petworth and East Cowes Castle, probably of the 1830s (Nos. 4457 and 449).There are some paint losses down the right-hand edge, particularly near the top; these have now been restored.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

This standard association led Wilson (and subsequently Turner) to add an incident from the myth of Diana to the foreground.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 17794: Small Thames Sketchesc.1807THESE eighteen sketches of various sizes, painted on mahogany veneer, are all from the Turner Bequest. They were included in the 1854 Schedule as Nos. 184 to 200*, 18 fragments various sizes on Veneers\u2014or thinpanels; in the 1856 Schedule no. 200* [N05534], was inadvertently omitted. They were first numbered, laid down on panels, cleaned and exhibited in 1908 and 1910.The identifiable subjects of these sketches are all on the Thames or its tributary the Wey; several of the Guildford and Godalming views were identified in 1970 by Christopher Pinsent, including No. 186 [N02309], formerly thought to show Windsor Castle. The same area, with the exception of Walton Bridges, is covered bydrawingsin the Windsor, Eton sketchbook and the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVII and XCVIII).The small Thames sketches on panel, like these two sketchbooks, were datedc.1807 by Finberg (1909, i, pp. 251, 253, and 1961, p. 137), a date that still seems most probable. However, in 1969 Gage divided the sketches into three groups and dated them all later. His first group, Nos. 17980 [N02308,N02306], 183 [N02305], 18792 and 194 [N02311], he associates with the Wey, Guildford sketchbook but datesc.180910. His second group, Nos. 184 [N02680] and 185 [N02681], he datesc.181112. His third group comprises Nos. 177 [N02312], 178 [N02678], 181 [N02313], 182 [N02679] and 186 [N02309] and is dated by him toc.1813 or even later, on account of a supposed similarity to the foliage ofCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]), and a greater accomplishment than the small oil sketches onpaperof Devonshire subjects done in 1813 (Nos. 21325). The Devonshire sketches, however, are not strictly comparable in either technique or general approach, and again it seems more likely that, as is argued in the case of the large Thames sketches oncanvas(Nos. 160176), the whole group represents a single campaign playing a crucial part in the rapid development of Turner's approach to nature in the exhibited pictures of 1807 and 1808. Indeed, in 1983 (exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789 no. 20), Gage dated No. 186 toc.1807 and conceded that Turner seemed to have ceasedpaintingthe small Thames sketches on mahogany veneer by about 1811.These sketches were probably done out-of-doors, perhaps from a small boat as the younger Trimmer described, even though he talks of Turner using a large canvas (see p. 116). In them Turner approaches nearest to what Constable termed a natural painter, but, unlike Constable, Turner always seems to have been interested in making a complete pictorialcompositioneven when he came closest to recording a direct experience of nature.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 368; Clark 1949, pp. 989; Finberg 1961, pp. 1367; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, p. 77; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 234; Gage 1965, p. 75 n. 2; Gage 1969, p. 38; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 1619, 228; Wilton 1979, pp. 11118; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789.192.[N02677]Newark Abbey on the Weyc.1807THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2677)Mahogany veneer, 14 1/2 \u00d7 28 15/16 (37 \u00d7 73\u00b75); an irregular strip lower right,  7/16 \u00d7 4 5/8 (1 \u00d7 10\u00b75), is a restorationColl.Turner Bequest 1856 (one of 184200*); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1919.Exh.Tate Gallery 1931 (64); Amsterdam, Berne, Paris, Brussels, Liege (8), Venice and Rome (9) 19478.Lit.Davies 1946, p. 189 n. 19; Gage 1969, pp. 378.See No. 191[N02302].

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.Nos. 31827 Small Italian Sketches, 1828?THESE small sketches on millboard are distinct in style from those, also from the Turner Bequest, found at the British Museum (Nos. 485500). Several are painted on muslin stretched over the millboard, but there is evidence that one of the sketches on muslin was originally on the same piece of millboard as one of those painted directly onto the board (see Nos. 324 [N05545] and 325 [N05535]). A number of these sketches seem to show landscapes in the vicinity of Rome and Naples. Though very different from earlier sketches from nature like those done of the Thamesc.1807 (Nos. 16094) they have a directness and freshness which suggests that they may also have been done out-of-doors, though with formal compositions in mind from the outset. There is no secure evidence that Turner went to Naples on his second visit to Rome but it would have been easy for him to do so, and this group of sketches has usually been dated to this visit. Nevertheless, they could have been done on the 1819 visit, when, however, Turner did a far greater amount of work onpaper. Evelyn Joll, in the 19834 Paris exhibition catalogue (p. 111), stresses the factors in favour of an 1819 dating though he does not commit himself to this; see also under Nos. 318 [N05526] and 319 [N05530].326.[N05524]A Seashore1828?THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5524)Muslin mounted on millboard, 16 3/8 \u00d7 20 1/2 (41\u00b75 \u00d7 52)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (181, one of 5 each 1'8 7/4\" \u00d7 1'4 1/2\", see No. 323 [N05532]; identified by chalk number on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 165, 189; Gage 1969, pp. 39, 232 n. 106.See No. 327 [N05481] for the possible dating of this group of sketches of the sea.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.Nos. 30217 Roman Sketches, 1828THE first seven of these oil sketches (Nos. 3028) were originally on one large canvas; the compositions were separated in 191314. The nine others are similar in style, technique and type of canvas but are not recorded as having been originally joined. However, this second group of sketches shares with the first the peculiarity of having been tacked to some sort of stretcher or support from the front, Turner having gone over the tacks with paint in the process of painting each composition. This suggests that in both cases a large piece of canvas was remounted on a relatively small support each time Turner wanted to paint a new sketch. Both groups are marked by a vertical craquelure, the result of rolling. The 1856 Schedule of the Turner Bequest lists under nos. 20318 four Roll[s] containing 4 subjects, only two of which are accounted for by the Cowes sketches, one of which in fact contained five compositions (see p. 159); the other two rolls could have been that bearing Nos. 3028 together with one containing the other Roman sketches.Those subjects that can be identified are Italian and the first sketch was used for the large picture ofUlysses and Polyphemusexhibited at the R.A. in 1829 (No. 330 [N00508]). It therefore seems likely that they were done in Italy during Turner's second visit in 18289, the use of large rolls of canvas being presumably for ease of transport as seems to have been the case with the Cowes sketches. However, the canvas is not identical with that of the pictures that were exhibited by Turner in Rome (see Nos. 2924 [N00511,N00513,N00519]), nor did those pictures reach London, having been sent by sea, until after the opening of the 1829 R.A. Exhibition, but Turner would not have needed thePolyphemussketch directly in front of him to paint the large picture. Alternatively, whereas Nos. 2924 [N00511,N00513,N00519], and also Nos. 2969 [N05498, N005517,N05509,N05510] and 301 [N05473], seem to have been stretched in Rome and were probably all sent back by sea, Turner could have taken the rolled canvases back with him by land.Unlike the Cowes sketches, which seem to have been the direct result of specific experiences even if not actually painted on the spot, these works are essays in composition; even those based on actual landscapes are of places already known to Turner from his travels in Italy in 1819 if not from pictures by other artists: both Lake Nemi and Tivoli (for which see Nos. 44 [N05512] and 545 [N05538]) had been painted by Wilson. They are studies in broad areas of strongly contrastedtonesof flatly applied colour, occasionally enlivened, as in the case ofLake Nemi, by a flurry of heavyimpasto. The subjects range from recognisable Italian landscapes, through thePolyphemussketch which uses landscape motives based on what Turner could have seen in Italy, to Claudian seaports which depend entirely on the work of another artist. Differing in size one from the other, and not adhering to any of the standard sizes normally used by Turner, these works are definitely sketches rather than unfinished paintings which could have been carried further.Lit.MacColl 1920, p. 42; Davies 1946, p. 189; Kitson 1983, p. 13.309.[N03380]Rocky Bay1828THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (3380)Canvas, irregular, approx. 23 3/4 \u00d7 36 1/8 (60\u00b75 \u00d7 92)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (? one of 20318; see p. 176); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1920.Exh.Tokyo and Kyoto 197071 (39, repr.).There are apparently irregularly placed tack holes along the top edge, supporting the probability that this sketch and Nos. 31017 [N03381-N03388] were originally on a single roll of canvas like Nos. 3028; see p. 176.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

That picture is now numbered 270*, the other of larger dimensions, being numbered 270. An unfinished picture of large dimensions, numbered 250 in Schedule A, was not found among the pictures transferred to the National Gallery, but was found, so numbered, in Queen Anne St[Turner's studio] and, together with the other works found there has now been removed to the National Gallery. This large picture was No. 529 [N05544].There is a hole in thecanvasnear the top right-hand corner and two small tears bottom left; these have been provisionally secured. The picture is still very dirty and is in need of further treatment.Most of the ground was left uncovered, but where Turner has begun work he has shown ships and architectural forms in considerable detail, those on the right being drawn with the brush rather than painted however. These features suggest that Turner was planning another Carthaginian port scene. The date could be any time between 1815 and 1840, probably more towards the latter.Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.Nos. 30217 Roman Sketches, 1828THE first seven of these oil sketches (Nos. 3028) were originally on one large canvas; the compositions were separated in 191314. The nine others are similar in style, technique and type of canvas but are not recorded as having been originally joined. However, this second group of sketches shares with the first the peculiarity of having been tacked to some sort of stretcher or support from the front, Turner having gone over the tacks with paint in the process of painting each composition. This suggests that in both cases a large piece of canvas was remounted on a relatively small support each time Turner wanted to paint a new sketch. Both groups are marked by a vertical craquelure, the result of rolling. The 1856 Schedule of the Turner Bequest lists under nos. 20318 four Roll[s] containing 4 subjects, only two of which are accounted for by the Cowes sketches, one of which in fact contained five compositions (see p. 159); the other two rolls could have been that bearing Nos. 3028 together with one containing the other Roman sketches.Those subjects that can be identified are Italian and the first sketch was used for the large picture ofUlysses and Polyphemusexhibited at the R.A. in 1829 (No. 330 [N00508]). It therefore seems likely that they were done in Italy during Turner's second visit in 18289, the use of large rolls of canvas being presumably for ease of transport as seems to have been the case with the Cowes sketches. However, the canvas is not identical with that of the pictures that were exhibited by Turner in Rome (see Nos. 2924 [N00511,N00513,N00519]), nor did those pictures reach London, having been sent by sea, until after the opening of the 1829 R.A. Exhibition, but Turner would not have needed thePolyphemussketch directly in front of him to paint the large picture. Alternatively, whereas Nos. 2924 [N00511,N00513,N00519], and also Nos. 2969 [N05498, N005517,N05509,N05510] and 301 [N05473], seem to have been stretched in Rome and were probably all sent back by sea, Turner could have taken the rolled canvases back with him by land.Unlike the Cowes sketches, which seem to have been the direct result of specific experiences even if not actually painted on the spot, these works are essays in composition; even those based on actual landscapes are of places already known to Turner from his travels in Italy in 1819 if not from pictures by other artists: both Lake Nemi and Tivoli (for which see Nos. 44 [N05512] and 545 [N05538]) had been painted by Wilson. They are studies in broad areas of strongly contrastedtonesof flatly applied colour, occasionally enlivened, as in the case ofLake Nemi, by a flurry of heavyimpasto. The subjects range from recognisable Italian landscapes, through thePolyphemussketch which uses landscape motives based on what Turner could have seen in Italy, to Claudian seaports which depend entirely on the work of another artist. Differing in size one from the other, and not adhering to any of the standard sizes normally used by Turner, these works are definitely sketches rather than unfinished paintings which could have been carried further.Lit.MacColl 1920, p. 42; Davies 1946, p. 189; Kitson 1983, p. 13.305.[N02990]Ariccia (?): Sunset1828THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2990)Canvas, 23 3/4 \u00d7 31 1/2 (60\u00b75 \u00d7 79\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (? one of 20318; see p. 176); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1919.Exh.Australian tour 1960 (8); Munich 1983 (140, repr.).Lit.MacColl 1920, p. 43; Herrmann 1975, p. 35, colour pl. 90.Repr.Gaunt 1971, colour pl. 7.The tentative identification of the hill town as Ariccia, near Rome, is MacColl's, but, as has been pointed out in the catalogue of the 1983 Munich exhibition, there was no viaduct at Ariccia until 1854.

Martin Davies identified thepaintingas representing Death before Dishonour. The present title, derived from seventeenth-century Dutch prototypes, is due to Lawrence Gowing.At all events this unfinished oil, painted in a generally Titianesque manner, is probably fairly early, deriving from Turner's experience of Titian at the Louvre in 1802, rather than from the period of such figure paintings of comparable scale as No. 448 [N05501]. On the other hand, it could have resulted from Turner's renewed interest in Titian during his Italian journey of 18289;c.f.Nos. 293 [N00513] and 296 [N05498].

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 17794: Small Thames Sketchesc.1807THESE eighteen sketches of various sizes, painted on mahogany veneer, are all from the Turner Bequest. They were included in the 1854 Schedule as Nos. 184 to 200*, 18 fragments various sizes on Veneers\u2014or thinpanels; in the 1856 Schedule no. 200* [N05534], was inadvertently omitted. They were first numbered, laid down on panels, cleaned and exhibited in 1908 and 1910.The identifiable subjects of these sketches are all on the Thames or its tributary the Wey; several of the Guildford and Godalming views were identified in 1970 by Christopher Pinsent, including No. 186 [N02309], formerly thought to show Windsor Castle. The same area, with the exception of Walton Bridges, is covered bydrawingsin the Windsor, Eton sketchbook and the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVII and XCVIII).The small Thames sketches on panel, like these two sketchbooks, were datedc.1807 by Finberg (1909, i, pp. 251, 253, and 1961, p. 137), a date that still seems most probable. However, in 1969 Gage divided the sketches into three groups and dated them all later. His first group, Nos. 17980 [N02308,N02306], 183 [N02305], 18792 and 194 [N02311], he associates with the Wey, Guildford sketchbook but datesc.180910. His second group, Nos. 184 [N02680] and 185 [N02681], he datesc.181112. His third group comprises Nos. 177 [N02312], 178 [N02678], 181 [N02313], 182 [N02679] and 186 [N02309] and is dated by him toc.1813 or even later, on account of a supposed similarity to the foliage ofCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]), and a greater accomplishment than the small oil sketches onpaperof Devonshire subjects done in 1813 (Nos. 21325). The Devonshire sketches, however, are not strictly comparable in either technique or general approach, and again it seems more likely that, as is argued in the case of the large Thames sketches oncanvas(Nos. 160176), the whole group represents a single campaign playing a crucial part in the rapid development of Turner's approach to nature in the exhibited pictures of 1807 and 1808. Indeed, in 1983 (exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789 no. 20), Gage dated No. 186 toc.1807 and conceded that Turner seemed to have ceasedpaintingthe small Thames sketches on mahogany veneer by about 1811.These sketches were probably done out-of-doors, perhaps from a small boat as the younger Trimmer described, even though he talks of Turner using a large canvas (see p. 116). In them Turner approaches nearest to what Constable termed a natural painter, but, unlike Constable, Turner always seems to have been interested in making a complete pictorialcompositioneven when he came closest to recording a direct experience of nature.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 368; Clark 1949, pp. 989; Finberg 1961, pp. 1367; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, p. 77; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 234; Gage 1965, p. 75 n. 2; Gage 1969, p. 38; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 1619, 228; Wilton 1979, pp. 11118; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789.190.[N02304]Godalming from the Southc.1807THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2304)Mahogany veneer, 8 \u00d7 13 3/4 (20 \u00d7 35)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (one of 184200*); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1910, returned to the National Gallery 1952, and to the Tate Gallery 1961.Exh.19745 (136); Cambridge and R.A. 19801 (54, repr.).Lit.MacColl 1920, p. 36; Davies 1946, p. 189 n. 19; 1959, p. 101; Gage 1969, p. 38.Godalming is one of the places listed inside the front cover of the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVIII).Published in:Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll,The Paintings of J.M.W.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Works Painted in Rome, 18289TURNER went to Rome for the second time in 1828, leaving England in August and arriving in October; he stayed until early January 1829, and was back in England in February. Sir Charles Eastlake told Thornbury that they both stayed at 12 Piazza Mignanelli and that Turner painted there the \u201cView of Orvieto\u201d, the \u201cRegulus\u201d and the \u201cMedea\u201d [Nos. 292 [N00511], 294 [N00519] and 293 [N00513]]. Those pictures were exhibited in Rome in some rooms which Turner subsequently occupied at the Quattro Fontane. The foreign artists who went to see them could make nothing of them. However, Eastlake reported a more mixed reception in a letter to England in February 1829: More than a thousand persons went to see his works when exhibited, so you can imagine how astonished, enraged or delighted the different schools of artists were, at seeing things with methods so new, so daring and excellences so unequivocal. The angry critics have, I believe, talked most, and it is possible you may hear ofgeneralseverity of judgment, but many did justice, and many more were fain to admire what they confessed they dared not imitate.Turner advertised in theDiario di Romafor 17 December 1828 that he was to exhibit due Paesaggi for a week at the Palazzo Trulli. These John Gage identifies asOrvietoandRegulus, though it is known thatMedeawas on view on 17 December. In a letter of February 1829, Eastlake confirmed that Turner had exhibited these three works, as well as having begun eight or ten pictures (for a later letter by Eastlake, see No. 328a).A number ofpaintingsfrom the Turner Bequest are identical in their coarsecanvas, the form of the original stretcher, and the way in which the canvas was fastened to the stretcher (with upholsterer's sprigs) toOrvietoandMedea(Regulusis on a similar canvas, but has lost its original stretcher and form of attachment). These are the three figure subjects, Nos. 296 [N05498], 297 [N05517] and 298 [N05509], andSouthernLandscape, No. 299 [N05510]. Other works probably from the group are Nos. 300 [N05506] and 301 [N05473]. Other candidates for works begun in Rome are thecompositionsketches on a similar though even rather coarser canvas, Nos. 30217; see p. 160. These sketches, and one of the larger unfinished pictures (No. 300), shows signs of having been rolled, presumably for ease of despatch to London. Both types of coarse canvas would seem to be Italian in origin, presumably purchased in Rome. Probably also from this trip are the smaller sketches on millboard. Nos. 31827.Turner had in fact written from Paris on II August 1828 to Charles Eastlake, who was already in Rome, asking him to secure one or two canvases, 59 1/4 \u00d7 98 1/2 in., so that he could begin straight away on a landscape for Lord Egremont. This is generally held to bePalestrina(No. 295 [N06283]), which measures 55 1/4 \u00d7 98 in. but is in fact on a fine canvas.Turner himself reported his progress in a letter to Sir Francis Chantrey of 6 November 1828: I have confined myself to the painting department...and having finishedone, am about the second, and getting on with Lord E's [presumablyPalestrina], which I began the very first touch at Rome; but as folk here talked that I would show themnot, I finished a small three feet four to stop their gabbling; this last was presumablyOrvieto.Eastlake's account in Thornbury goes on, When those same works were packed to be sent to England, I advised him to have the cover covered with waxed cloth, as the pictures without it might be exposed to wet. Turner thanked me, and said the advice was important; \u201cfor\u201d, he added, \u201cif any wet gets to them, they will be destroyed.\u201d This indicates his practice of preparing his pictures with a kind oftempera, a method which, before the surface was varnished, was not waterproof [in fact analysis has not revealed any tempera, though Turner did quite often usewatercolouron his oils and in at least one case, No. 300, a picture apparently from this group seems to have suffered losses to its water-soluble glazes]. The pictures referred to were in fact not finished; nor could any of his exhibited pictures be said to be finished till he had worked on them when they were on the walls of the RoyalAcademy. This is supported by the review ofOrvietoin theMorning Chroniclefor 3 May 1830 quoted underPilate washing his Hands(No. 332 [N00510]). Although Turner had hoped that his Rome paintings would reach London in time for the 1829 Exhibition, there were shipping delays andOrvietoandPalestrinawere not exhibited until 1830, norMedeauntil 1831;Reguluswas not exhibited until 1837.Lit.Thornbury 1862, i, p. 221; 1877, p. 100; Finberg 1961, pp. 30711; Gage 1968, pp. 67980; Gage 1980, pp. 11820, 125, 127, 132.Nos. 31827 Small Italian Sketches, 1828?THESE small sketches on millboard are distinct in style from those, also from the Turner Bequest, found at the British Museum (Nos. 485500). Several are painted on muslin stretched over the millboard, but there is evidence that one of the sketches on muslin was originally on the same piece of millboard as one of those painted directly onto the board (see Nos. 324 [N05545] and 325 [N05535]). A number of these sketches seem to show landscapes in the vicinity of Rome and Naples. Though very different from earlier sketches from nature like those done of the Thamesc.1807 (Nos. 16094) they have a directness and freshness which suggests that they may also have been done out-of-doors, though with formal compositions in mind from the outset. There is no secure evidence that Turner went to Naples on his second visit to Rome but it would have been easy for him to do so, and this group of sketches has usually been dated to this visit. Nevertheless, they could have been done on the 1819 visit, when, however, Turner did a far greater amount of work onpaper. Evelyn Joll, in the 19834 Paris exhibition catalogue (p. 111), stresses the factors in favour of an 1819 dating though he does not commit himself to this; see also under Nos. 318 [N05526] and 319 [N05530].323.[N05532]Hilly Landscape with Tower?1828?THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (5532)Muslin mounted on millboard, 16 9/16 \u00d7 20 5/8 (42 \u00d7 52\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (182, one of 5 each 1'9 1/4\" \u00d7 1'7 1/2\", with Nos. 3246 and ?327; identified by chalk number on back); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1947.Lit.Davies 1946, pp. 166, 189.Another of the group of sketches tentatively associated with Turner's second Italian visit of 18289; see p. 179.

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 17794: Small Thames Sketchesc.1807THESE eighteen sketches of various sizes, painted on mahogany veneer, are all from the Turner Bequest. They were included in the 1854 Schedule as Nos. 184 to 200*, 18 fragments various sizes on Veneers\u2014or thinpanels; in the 1856 Schedule no. 200* [N05534], was inadvertently omitted. They were first numbered, laid down on panels, cleaned and exhibited in 1908 and 1910.The identifiable subjects of these sketches are all on the Thames or its tributary the Wey; several of the Guildford and Godalming views were identified in 1970 by Christopher Pinsent, including No. 186 [N02309], formerly thought to show Windsor Castle. The same area, with the exception of Walton Bridges, is covered bydrawingsin the Windsor, Eton sketchbook and the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVII and XCVIII).The small Thames sketches on panel, like these two sketchbooks, were datedc.1807 by Finberg (1909, i, pp. 251, 253, and 1961, p. 137), a date that still seems most probable. However, in 1969 Gage divided the sketches into three groups and dated them all later. His first group, Nos. 17980 [N02308,N02306], 183 [N02305], 18792 and 194 [N02311], he associates with the Wey, Guildford sketchbook but datesc.180910. His second group, Nos. 184 [N02680] and 185 [N02681], he datesc.181112. His third group comprises Nos. 177 [N02312], 178 [N02678], 181 [N02313], 182 [N02679] and 186 [N02309] and is dated by him toc.1813 or even later, on account of a supposed similarity to the foliage ofCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]), and a greater accomplishment than the small oil sketches onpaperof Devonshire subjects done in 1813 (Nos. 21325). The Devonshire sketches, however, are not strictly comparable in either technique or general approach, and again it seems more likely that, as is argued in the case of the large Thames sketches oncanvas(Nos. 160176), the whole group represents a single campaign playing a crucial part in the rapid development of Turner's approach to nature in the exhibited pictures of 1807 and 1808. Indeed, in 1983 (exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789 no. 20), Gage dated No. 186 toc.1807 and conceded that Turner seemed to have ceasedpaintingthe small Thames sketches on mahogany veneer by about 1811.These sketches were probably done out-of-doors, perhaps from a small boat as the younger Trimmer described, even though he talks of Turner using a large canvas (see p. 116). In them Turner approaches nearest to what Constable termed a natural painter, but, unlike Constable, Turner always seems to have been interested in making a complete pictorialcompositioneven when he came closest to recording a direct experience of nature.Lit.MacColl 1920, pp. 368; Clark 1949, pp. 989; Finberg 1961, pp. 1367; Herrmann 1963, p. 12; Kitson 1964, p. 77; Rothenstein and Butlin 1964, pp. 234; Gage 1965, p. 75 n. 2; Gage 1969, p. 38; Reynolds 1969, p. 71; Ziff 1971, p. 125; Herrmann 1975, pp. 1619, 228; Wilton 1979, pp. 11118; Ziff 1980, p. 169; Youngblood 1982, pp. 21, 34 nn. 9 and 23; Gage in exh. cat., Paris 19834, pp. 789.189.[N02303]A Narrow Valleyc.1807THE TATE GALLERY, LONDON (2303)Mahogany veneer, 8 1/8 \u00d7 6 1/2 (20\u00b75 \u00d7 16\u00b75)Coll.Turner Bequest 1856 (one of 184200*); transferred to the Tate Gallery 1910.Exh.Tokyo and Kyoto 197071 (35, repr.); Lisbon 1973 (1, repr.); Stockholm 1984 (4, repr. p. 15).Lit.Davies 1946, p. 189 n. 19; Gage 1969, p. 38.Christopher Pinsent identifies this as almost certainly another view of Guildford from the South (letter of 2 March 1970).

    "description": "Catalogue entry[from]Nos. 17794: Small Thames Sketchesc.1807THESE eighteen sketches of various sizes, painted on mahogany veneer, are all from the Turner Bequest. They were included in the 1854 Schedule as Nos. 184 to 200*, 18 fragments various sizes on Veneers\u2014or thinpanels; in the 1856 Schedule no. 200* [N05534], was inadvertently omitted. They were first numbered, laid down on panels, cleaned and exhibited in 1908 and 1910.The identifiable subjects of these sketches are all on the Thames or its tributary the Wey; several of the Guildford and Godalming views were identified in 1970 by Christopher Pinsent, including No. 186 [N02309], formerly thought to show Windsor Castle. The same area, with the exception of Walton Bridges, is covered bydrawingsin the Windsor, Eton sketchbook and the Wey, Guildford sketchbook (XCVII and XCVIII).The small Thames sketches on panel, like these two sketchbooks, were datedc.1807 by Finberg (1909, i, pp. 251, 253, and 1961, p. 137), a date that still seems most probable. However, in 1969 Gage divided the sketches into three groups and dated them all later. His first group, Nos. 17980 [N02308,N02306], 183 [N02305], 18792 and 194 [N02311], he associates with the Wey, Guildford sketchbook but datesc.180910. His second group, Nos. 184 [N02680] and 185 [N02681], he datesc.181112. His third group comprises Nos. 177 [N02312], 178 [N02678], 181 [N02313], 182 [N02679] and 186 [N02309] and is dated by him toc.1813 or even later, on account of a supposed similarity to the foliage ofCrossing the Brook, exhibited in 1815 (No. 130 [N00497]), and a greater accomplishment than the small oil sketches onpaperof Devonshire subjects done in 1813 (Nos. 21325). The Devonshire sketches, however, are not strictly comparable in either technique or general approach, and again it seems more likely that, as is argued in the case of the large Thames sketches oncanvas(Nos. 160176), the whole group represents a single campaign playing a crucial part in the rapid development of Turner's approach to nature in the exhibited pictures of 1807 and 1808.
