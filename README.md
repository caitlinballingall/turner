# turner

This python code was created for my Programming for Cultural Heritage class at Pratt. The python code scrapes the Tate Collection 
using beautifulsoup, specifically scraping for Joseph Mallord William Turner paintings. There are two files, one file scrapes for 
all the Turner paintings in the collection, and the other file for all the works the artist created that dipict the Isle of Wight, UK. 
The code outputs a json file that can then be converted to csv for ease of use and classification.
